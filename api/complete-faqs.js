    "question": "Is the USS *Pampanito* (SS-383) really a submarine?",
    "answer": "That is actually a valid question. Modern submarines, even the non-nuclear boats of other navies, don't look anything like the *Pampanito* from the outside. They are sleek black shapes and are mostly underwater. Only a little of the hull shows along with the upright sail. Unlike the *Pampanito,* they have no guns. But, yes, this is what was described as a submarine in World War 2.",

    "question": "What do you mean when you say this is what we called a submarine?",
    "answer": "This is as far as the technology could go in the early 1940s. However, these boats, and all others of that era, technically, were just submersibles. They were surface ships that could submerge for relatively brief periods (usually 16 hours or so), could fight submerged and then could come back to the surface. The first true submarine was the USS *Nautilus* (SSN-571) which was commissioned in 1954. With nuclear power she could operate underwater for months at a time and did not have to surface regularly for fresh air or to recharge batteries. She was designed to operate underwater for the vast majority of the time.",

    "question": "How different are modern submarines?",
    "answer": "Visitors who have served on our latest submarines tell us that they are completely different from the *Pampanito* and exactly the same. They are telling us that the functions are the same -- diving, surfacing, being quiet, being sneaky, gathering intelligence, and attacking the ships of an enemy in wartime. How those functions are accomplished may be very different. Buttons, switches and computers help to accomplish many tasks that were very manual on the *Pampanito*. In addition, modern submarines are much larger and cleaner. However, there isn't enough space to play basketball. ***Pampanito* is much bigger than I expected. I thought submarines were crowded.** The boat is long but narrow. It is almost 312 feet long. However, the pressure hull, where the crew lived and worked, is only 16 feet in diameter and around 280 feet long. The bottom level is all machinery and much more equipment is on the main level such as the tops of the engines and generators, fresh water stills, torpedo tubes, reload torpedoes and the boat's controls. As a result, there isn't much room left for the crew. The submarine looks much bigger from the outside than it does from the inside, particularly with 80 crew members on board.",

    "question": "Is a submarine a boat or a ship?",
    "answer": "Most often the difference between boats and ships is based on size and whether the vessel is ocean-going. A boat is generally a smaller vessel that can be carried by a ship. A ship cannot be carried by a boat. Other vessels that are generally too large to be carried may also be referred to as boats such as ferry boats, tour boats and fishing boats. By this definition, submarines such as the *Pampanito* are technically ships. However, the original submarines were boats by the formal definition. They were carried to the point of attack and were not suitable for lengthy ocean transits. As a result, by tradition, all submarines are still referred to as boats even though some of the newer ones are huge in comparison. Submarines can be referred to both as ships and boats, with \"boats\" being far more common.",

    "question": "Is the submarine a battleship?",
    "answer": "That depends on your definition of a battleship. These submarines were combatant ships and did go into battle. However, in WW2, there was a specific type of ship called a battleship. Those ships were large, heavy vessels with many guns. The biggest of our battleships had nine 16-inch guns and as many as 20 five-inch guns, 48 Bofors 40 mm guns in mounts of four, and 52 Oerlikon 20 mm guns each. The battleships we built were 25 times larger, by displacement (or heavier), than the *Pampanito*. In WW2, submarines were certainly in battles, but were not referred to as battleships.",

    "question": "Where is the pressure hull? Can I see it from the pier?",
    "answer": "The pressure hull or \"people pipe\" is below the main deck and between the sets of ballast and fuel tanks on both sides of the boat. Most of the pressure hull is hidden by the tanks on both sides and the main deck above.",

    "question": "Where do the torpedoes come out?",
    "answer": "The outer doors for the forward tubes are all the way forward and just below the first row of limber holes. It is a rectangular structure that moves in toward the boat when opened. The same is true of the after tubes although there are no limber holes near the after outer doors. The outer doors for the top tubes, both forward and aft are visible on the *Pampanito.* You can see the outline of the rectangular doors. That is because the boat is currently much lighter than it was when it was operational. It does not have the 100 tons of battery cells, the nearly 400 tons of fuel, the full complement of torpedoes with live warheads, the food for the crew plus the 80 sailors and their gear. If that were all on board, the boat would be sitting deeper in the water and the torpedo doors would be under water.",

    "question": "What is a \"ladder\"?",
    "answer": "A ladder, in Navy speak, is a set of stairs or steps on a ship. Most of the original ladders on the *Pampanito* actually resemble the almost straight up and down ladders around your home. However, they were not as easily moved. Surface ships have ladders that look more like stairs. Those are similar to what was added in the torpedo rooms for visitors and old docents to enter and exit the *Pampanito* museum.",

    "id": 12,
    "question": "What is a \"watertight door\"?",
    "answer": "A watertight door is the opening between the compartments on a submarine. The doors are very heavy since they are designed to withstand sea pressure. This is so they can prevent flooding from moving from one compartment to the next. At a depth of 400 feet, the outside water pressure is about 175 PSI. The weight needed to withstand that pressure helps to explain their small size. There are no watertight doors on the lower level. To go from one compartment to the next on that level, one would have to go up to the main level, move to the desired compartment, and then go back down.",

    "id": 13,
    "question": "Why are there so many doorways to go through?",
    "answer": "The submarine is divided up into eight compartments on the main level. (The Conning Tower is a separate compartment above the pressure hull.) These compartments are designed so that if any one of them were to be flooded, the boat could still get back to the surface. (That is a theory that may never have been proven during actual operations.) The compartments are also divided functionally so that noise and light can be suppressed, particularly at night.",

    "question": "Maneuvering room including:",
    "answer": "- The cubicle which is where power is distributed. - The large levers direct the power from an engine-generator combination either to the battery charge or to operate the boat. These are separate circuits. When the boat is submerged, the levers are changed to take the power from the battery to operate the boat. - Main motors on the lower level to drive the propellors via the reduction gears. There are two motors per propellor shaft. - Motor order telegraphs. These receive the orders from the bridge of conning tower for the desired speed. They are then used to acknowledge the orders received and being executed. There are two units, one for each propellor shaft. - Lathe for repairs. - An inverter to provide A/C power from the D/C battery or generators. - Log (or engineer's) office. This tiny space is the second largest office on the boat. > **After engine room including:** - Two Fairbanks Morse, 10 cylinder, opposed-piston main engines producing about 1,500 horsepower each. The engines extend to the lower level. - Two generators (one attached to each engine) to produce the needed electrical power. - A smaller, \"donkey\" diesel on the lower level that can be used to top off a battery charge. This is a smaller Fairbanks-Morse, 7 cylinder, opposed-piston engine with associated generator. These smaller engines were removed from active submarines in the 1950s. - Clean fuel tank. - Normal lube oil tank. - Associated fuel and oil pumps and filters. > **Forward engine room including:** - Two more Fairbanks-Morse main engine-generator combinations that also extend to the lower level. - Two Kleinschmidt stills for fresh water. - Air conditioning on the lower level. This has been described as functioning more as a dehumidifier rather than actual air conditioning. In other words, in WW2 it removed some moisture but didn't cool the air very well. - Clean fuel tank. - Normal lube oil tank. - Associated fuel and oil pumps and filters. > **After battery including:** - Crew's sinks, heads and showers. The two heads are behind the metal doors opposite the wash machine. - Half of the boat's battery, 126 cells, is on the lower level. - Fan unit to pull the hydrogen out of the battery well so it does not reach combustible levels when charging the battery. The air from the battery well is dumped into the engine rooms so the hydrogen can be burned. - Main crew's berthing with 36 bunks. - Pharmacist mate's medical locker. - Locker to hang service dress uniforms. - Smaller lockers for personal items. Some smaller items would be stored under the mattresses. - Ice cream machine. - Crew's mess with four tables seating six men each. Two tables have game boards embedded. - Galley, the small space next to the crew's mess where meals are cooked. The third cook, the overnight baker, prepares bread, rolls, cakes and pies in this space. - A large coffee maker; coffee is always available. - The ammunition locker is on the lower level, port side forward. The access hatch may be under the chest used for storage and seating. - Cold storage on the lower level. - Limited pantry space on the lower level. - Sinks to wash dishes. > **Control room. This is where the crew dives the boat, controls depth > and returns to the surface. It includes:** - Radio room with radios and encoding/decoding equipment. - Controls for the low-pressure blower, used to empty ballast tanks of the last of the water. - Periscope wells. The actual periscopes cannot be seen inside the wells nor can they be used from here. - High-pressure air manifold used to bring the boat back to the surface. - AC electrical switchboard. - Alarms -- diving, collision and general quarters (battle stations) on one of the pericope wells. - Announcing systems. - Trim manifold. - Air search radar. - IFF query and display. - Diving officer's checklist. - Radar equipment. - Bow and stern plane control wheels. - Ladder and hatch up to the conning tower. - Hatch and ladder down to the pump room. - Chief of the watch station with the \"Christmas Tree\" display of the status of key valves and hatches. - Controls to main ballast tank vents. - Controls to special ballast tanks and main induction. - LORAN (Long Range Aid to Navigation). - Gyrocompass. - Bathythermograph. - Fathometer. - Boat's safe topped by a ladder up to the main deck. This hatch has a small window to allow gun crews to see if the water above the hatch has drained away. - Backup helm. - Backup gyrocompass. - Magnetic compass. - Dead reckoning tracker. The display of *Pampanito's* war patrols is on this DRT. > Note: The control room on the *Pampanito* is configured with red > lights to show an example of the typical lighting at night. > > **The pump room which is below the control room.** - Air compressors. - Trim pumps. - Drain pumps. - Hydraulic pumps. - The low-pressure blower to empty ballast tanks of the last of the water. - On some boats, the safe is located here. > **Conning tower -- the enclosed space above the control room > including:** - Hatch and ladder down to control room - Helm. - Course indicator. - Rudder indicator. - Motor order telegraphs. - Alarms. - Announcing systems. - Ladder and hatch to the bridge. - Sonar displays and controls. - SJ surface search radar display and controls. - ST surface search radar display. This radar is in the search periscope. - Depth gauge. - Telegraph key. - Two periscopes, search and attack. - Dead reckoning tracker. - Torpedo data computer. - Torpedo firing keys. - Radio phone sets. - Sound-powered phones. > **Bridge -- the open space above the conning tower** **including:** - Target bearing transmitters. - Announcing systems. - Lookout platforms on the periscope shears. - Signal lamp. - Course indicator. - Ships' guns including 20 mm and 40 mm, as installed. > Returning to the main level inside the pressure hull forward of the > control room, we have the **forward battery including:** - Boat's office. This is the large office on the boat. - Chief petty officers' berthing, also known as the \"goat locker\". - Captain's cabin with desk and depth and course indicators. - The other half of the boat's battery, 126 cells, is on the lower level. - Fan unit to pull the hydrogen out of the battery well. - Officers' berthing. - Wardroom for officers' meals, meetings and work space. - Serving galley. Food is kept warm and served from here. It is not cooked here. > **Forward torpedo room** - Six torpedo tubes (also normally loaded) and 10 reloads in skids (trays). - Crew's bunks above the torpedoes. - Sonar equipment. Sonar can be operated from here, but there is no PPI display. - Charging unit for the Mark XVIII electric torpedoes. - Escape trunk. - Officers' head and shower. - This space has a shallow lower level that includes two of the six torpedo tubes and two of the reloads.",

    "question": "The control room has a lot of equipment. Is it the command center?",
    "answer": "Yes, it has a lot of equipment. No, it is not the command center. That would be either the conning tower, which is above the control room, or the bridge. The conning tower is the command center when the boat is submerged. It is always manned when at sea by a helmsman and quartermaster since steering and navigation are normally done from this space. Radar and sonar are also normally operated from this space. It would be very crowded during general quarters (battle stations) for submerged attacks with as many as 10 to 12 men in the space. The conning tower is only about 20 feet long and 10 feet in diameter. It is made of slightly thicker steel due to its vulnerability since it is closer to the surface. The bridge is the command center, where the officer of the deck will normally be, when surfaced. When on the surface, the officer of the deck is supported by the crewmen in the conning tower and control room. This is particularly true when attacking on the surface.",

    "answer": "This is the space where the Chief Petty Officers, the highest-ranking enlisted men, sleep. The space is so named because the chiefs are the \"old goats\" in the Navy. On a submarine in WW2, they were as \"old\" as 28 or 30 years old. In this case, goat is not necessarily GOAT, as in greatest of all time. Nor does it imply that the chiefs smelled more like goats than the rest of us. After a few days at sea, we all smelled pretty bad.

    "question": "How many submarines did we have in WW2?",
    "answer": "We started with about 50 operational submarines. We built 221 and we lost 52. We ended the war with 179 boats in service with about 40 more in sea trials or still being completed. Definitions vary so it can be difficult to get consistent, definitive numbers. Contracts for many more of the Balao and Tench class boats were cancelled when it became apparent that they would not be needed for the war. This refers only to operational boats. At the beginning of the war, we still had some old R-class boats and most of those were being used for training. Some S-class boats were being used for training while others were still operational boats at that time. (The R-boats go back to the early part of WW1 and the S-boats were built during and right after that war.) However, both classes had shorter range and many other limitations. The operational S-boats would become training boats as new construction could replace them.",

    "question": "What was built after the R and S class boats?",
    "answer": "We had built about 40 \"fleet boats\" in the 1930s. This includes the Porpoise, Perch, Salmon, Sargo and Tambor classes. These are the boats that were built as we incorporated new technologies and what we learned through operational experience. These boats were larger than the S-boats, had greater range and carried more torpedoes. They were almost the size of the Gato/Balao/Tench boats we built during the war and had similar capabilities. A table, below, compares the sizes of our submarine classes in WW2. The fleet boats were operational at the start of WW2 along with some of the S-boats. About 16 of the fleet boats were lost during the war. Many of the others were still in active service at the end of the war. > **NOTE:** The name \"fleet boats\" generally refers to the various > classes of US submarines built between WW1 and WW2. The reference is > to the fact that these boats were intended to sail with the fleet, or > ahead of it, and engage the enemy first. It was rarely practical for > these boats to sail with the fleet, but the name stuck. The name was > sometimes also applied to the Gato, Balao and Tench classes that we > built during the war. There were also a few larger boats built after WW1. These larger boats had two six-inch guns and they were slower and less maneuverable.

    "answer": "The first of the newest WW2 classes, the Gato boats, were just being commissioned when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. The design had been set in 1939 and then we started building the new class. This class, plus the Balao and Tench classes, were what we built during the war. All three classes were very similar, other than the thickness of the hull, and look the same to most observers. Sometimes all three classes are referred to as Gato boats. The Balao class boats had a thicker hull, at 7/8 inch rather than 11/16 inch. The hull was also strengthened to allow the boat to sit on the bottom. The Tench class kept those improvements and had some ballast tank piping rerouted for safety. We completed a total of about 77 Gato class, 119 Balao class and 25 Tench class boats during and shortly after the war.",

    "answer": "We had a huge Navy and decided to keep only about half of it active. That included aircraft carriers, cruisers and destroyers as well as submarines. Many of the ships we didn't keep were added to the reserve fleet. Others were used in live weapons tests or sold to friendly nations. The boats that we kept active after the war would be upgraded starting in the early 1950s. Guns were removed; the sail was streamlined and made more efficient. Snorkels were added so that boats did not have to surface to recharge the batteries or get fresh air in the boat. With a snorkel, that could now be done from periscope depth. Later, there would be a GUPPY program to improve battery capacity.",

    "question": "What was the reserve fleet?",
    "answer": "The reserve fleet, sometimes called the \"mothball fleet\", were boats that we kept on hand in case of new hostilities. The boats were unloaded, covered in protective coatings and then sealed up as much as practical. The idea was that it would be cheaper and faster to reactivate these boats and upgrade them to current standards than it would be to build new ones. Reserve fleets are being dismantled and the ships sold for scrap.",

    "question": "Did we use any of the reserve fleet submarines after WW2?",
    "answer": "We did. We reactivated and recommissioned a number of these boats for service during the Korean Conflict in the early 1950s. A few of those were kept active after the fighting ended but most went back into the reserve fleet. Other boats were sold to allies and friendly nations. Some of those were given upgrades first. Other boats from the reserve fleet were used as targets when testing new torpedoes. Still others were used in the atomic bomb testing in the Pacific. Lastly, some of the WW2 boats became museum submarines, such as the USS *Pampanito* (SS-383) here in San Francisco. By the late 1950s, we were building nuclear powered submarines. That meant that the WW2 boats were quickly outdated. By the end of 1973 nearly all of the World War 2 submarines had been decommissioned. However, some of the new classes of diesel submarines that we had built after the war were still in service in the U. S. Navy as late as 1988. Two of our WW2 submarines, the USS *Tusk* (SS-426) and the USS *Cutlass* (SS-478) were transferred to Taiwan and are still in service as of 2023. However, since they are now 80 years old, they are limited in their capabilities. Taiwan is now building new, non-nuclear submarines. > **NOTE:** Some of the battleships that were in the U.

    "question": "How many submarines were built in each shipyard?",

Their former > submarine base in Portsmouth, in the UK, was actually across the > harbor in Gosport. **Why was there such a difference in the numbers of boats built in each yard?** The first reason is that Electric Boat and the Portsmouth Naval Ship Yard were established yards and could ramp up production more quickly. They were experienced in building submarines. The Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company had not been building Navy ships at all. They did not finalize their first contract, for just 10 boats, until October of 1940. Mare Island Naval Shipyard was an experienced yard and had built submarines as well as ships of various types. However, it soon became apparent that the shipyard would be needed for submarine overhauls. That limited the amount of new submarine construction that could be completed. **What is different about a naval shipyard, like the ones in Portsmouth and Mare Island?** Naval shipyards are owned and operated by the government. Costs for building ships are based on the total costs for labor, materials and overhead. Civilian shipyards, such as Electric Boat and Manitowoc Shipbuilding, are profit making ventures. They add a reasonable profit to their estimated costs when entering into a contract with the government.",

    "question": "How much did these submarines cost?",
    "answer": "The numbers vary. The typical cost for boats from Portsmouth or Mare Island during WW2 is generally quoted at \\$5 million. The first contract for the boats from Manitowoc was for about \\$3 million and the second was for \\$3.2 million per boat, plus incentives for early completion. That doesn't necessarily mean that the boats built in the civilian yards are that much less expensive. It seems unlikely that the accounting is consistent. For example, did the private yards include the costs for the propellers, engines and batteries, which the shipyards didn't actually build? It seems likely that Navy yards included all costs while the contracts with the private yards may have only included the hull, wiring, piping, and installation of the engines and other large items. These prices are in 1940s dollars. \\$5 million in 1943 would be the equivalent of over \\$100 million today.",

    "question": "How long did it take to build these submarines?",
    "answer": "in the period between the two world wars, it could take as much as two to three years to complete a submarine. There was little urgency and we were likely making changes to the designs as we learned more about how prior boats performed. There was also some incentive to take longer in order to improve planning and to maintain staffing levels in the shipyards. However, by the late 1930s, as the war was on the horizon and more boats were being ordered, the typical time to complete a submarine was down to about a year and a half. When the war had broken out in Europe, contracts were being let to begin building ships to either keep us out of the war or to be able to fight it effectively. Construction had already begun, but not on a pace that would soon be needed. By the time we were in the war, in December of 1941, construction had already started to speed up. Submarine designs had been frozen and soon shipyards were operating 24 hours per day, seven days per week. Shipyards would also have multiple boats under construction at any one time. There would be some boats where the work had just begun and others farther along but still in drydocks. Others may have been launched but still needed a few a few months for more work to be completed. During the war, boats would usually be commissioned less than a year after construction began. For example, construction on the *Pampanito* began on March 15, 1943. She was commissioned on November 6, 1943. The submarine USS *Picuda* (SS-382) was started on the same day, in the same drydock. They were both launched on the 12^th^ of July. *Picuda* was commissioned about three weeks before *Pampanito*. The Portsmouth Naval Shipyard commissioned 32 of these submarines in 1944 alone. > **NOTE:** When a submarine is commissioned, the shipyard has completed > construction work.

    "question": "Were all of our newest WW2 submarines identical?",
    "answer": "As mentioned above, the three classes built during WW2 -- Gato, Balao and Tench -- were very similar but not quite identical. The Balao and Tench classes had thicker hulls and Tench boats had improved piping. This enabled the Balao and Tench boats to have an approved depth limit (test depth) of 400 feet or so vs. 300 feet for the Gatos. In addition, there could be some slight variation in equipment location. One tall skipper had the forward battery layout changed a bit so he could have a longer bunk and be able to stretch out. These variations were generally minor and were limited by functionality. Some changes depended on the preferences of the captains, most often on the commissioning (first) commanding officer. One of the more apparent variations was the location of the large cannon. It could be located either forward or aft of the sail. It depended on whether the captain expected it to be used more often offensively (usually forward) or defensively (aft of the sail). The gun could get moved after commissioning if the current captain could talk the shipyard into making the change during a refit or overhaul. If you knew one of these boats - or even an older fleet boat - and qualified on it, you wouldn't need much time at all to qualify on another. The differences among these three classes are not usually apparent to most observers.",

    "question": "How could they build submarines in Manitowoc on the Lake Michigan?",
    "answer": "The family-owned Manitowoc Shipbuilding Co. was an experienced shipyard. They had built many ships, such as ore carriers, that operated on the Great Lakes. When the war broke out, they wanted to assist in the war effort and keep their staff employed. Although they had no experience building submarines, and originally turned down the project, they worked with Electric Boat in New London to prepare. They then built 28 submarines as a subsidiary of Electric Boat. The sailors in Manitowoc boats really appreciated the high quality of the work. Manitowoc Shipbuilding faced multiple challenges: - In order to understand how each piping or wiring system fit with the whole and the order of installation for each one, the shipyard first built a full-sized model of a submarine out of wood. - They were building ocean-going submarines in a fresh water environment. Fresh water weighs less than sea water meaning that it doesn't support as much weight. That, in effect, makes the completed submarine act as if it were tons heavier. They had to compensate for that so the boat wouldn't go straight to the bottom when it submerged the first time. - Manitowoc submarines had to be launched sideways at commissioning due to the location on a river. That had never been done with these boats. There was concern that the sudden roll would damage some of the battery cells or that the boat would roll over. The engineers decided to launch without the battery cells installed and calculated the expected roll of the boat. The calculations were exactly correct and everything worked out well. - Winter conditions on the Great Lakes are harsher than in Portsmouth, New London or Mare Island. The submarines undergoing sea trials in winter collected quite a bit of ice when on the surface. Much of that had to be removed before diving because of the added weight. It made the boat top heavy and less stable. This was also an issue, although to a lesser extent, in Portsmouth and New London. - The boats then had to be sailed or transported to salt water. In spite of all the things the Manitowoc shipyard had to do just to be able to build these boats, they completed nearly all of them ahead of plan and under budget. All but one of the boats were completed ahead of schedule, entitling the shipyard to performance bonuses. They accepted some of the bonuses but not all, since they thought it improper to make too much profit during the war. The shipyard was also building landing craft and heavy cranes at the same time. That construction did not interfere with building submarines or vice versa.",

    "question": "How did Manitowoc get the boats to the ocean?",
    "answer": "Today, that would be straightforward. You would just sail the boats to the Atlantic Ocean using the St. Lawrence Seaway. However, that wasn't completed until 1959. In 1941, the locks in the Erie Canal could not accommodate a ship longer than 300 feet and the locks on the St. Lawrence River were even shorter. These submarines were nearly 312 feetlong. Therefore, the only water route available was through the Chicago Sanitary Canal to the Illinois River and then the Mississippi down to the Gulf of Mexico. (Yes, the Chicago sewage canal.) The submarines would be towed through Chicago to Lockport, IL, loaded onto a floating drydock (somewhat similar to a barge) and towed (pushed) down the rivers. The Manitowoc shipyard needed to buy or build the drydocks. Chicago had built drawbridges which would have allowed the drydock to navigate the Sanitary Canal had the they all been finished. The bridges were all functional for road traffic, but some of them didn't open. The shipyard needed to complete the rest of the mechanisms to raise the bridges. The completed submarines on the floating drydocks still would not fit under all the bridges on the Mississippi. To solve that, the periscope shears, periscopes and radar masts were all removed before being loaded on the drydocks before Chicago and were reinstalled in New Orleans. One interesting story concerns a delay due to high water in spring on the Mississippi. They had to wait several days for lower levels of water in the river in order to get under bridges. There was no alternative other than to tie the tug and floating drydock up to trees and wait. At times, submarine builders needed to be as resourceful as submariners.",

    "question": "Did \"Rosie the Riveter\" help build submarines?",
    "answer": "She certainly did. However, just for clarification, submarines were no longer riveted as they had been in World War 1. They were welded. As a result, it might be more accurate to say that \"Wendy the Welder\" helped build submarines. In any case, many women went to work in defense plants during the war. Some did administrative work and others did drawing jobs. But many others did the riveting and the welding. In fact, after initially resisting having women in the shipyards, management often found that women were better welders than the men. They were patient and some skills, such as sewing, did make the training easier. Two of Pampanito's engines were named, somewhat unflatteringly, after two of the women who worked in the Portsmouth shipyard.",

    "question": "How big were our submarines in WW2?",
    "answer": "Most of our submarines were about the same size as the *Pampanito*. The boats built during the war were almost 312 feet long (311 feet and 9 inches) and 27 feet wide at the widest. The pressure hull (sometimes referred to as the people pipe) is 16 feet in diameter in most places, around 275 to 280 feet long and is tapered at the ends. The Conning Tower is about 20 feet long and 10 feet in diameter. Surface displacement is about 1,550 tons and submerged is about 2,400 tons. These newer boats had 10 torpedo tubes -- six forward and four aft -- and a full complement of torpedoes was 24. They had four main engine/generator combinations, plus a smaller diesel in the lower flats of the after engine room. The main engines produced around 1,500 horsepower each, whether they were built by Fairbanks-Morse or General Motors Winton. The 40 or so \"fleet boats\" that were most of our submarines at the outset of WW2 were about 10 feet shorter than the Pampanito, a bit narrower and lacked the hard bulkhead to divide the engine rooms. Some fleet boats had only eight torpedo tubes and others had ten. Generally, they only carried 20 torpedoes but some could carry four more in external containers. Their speed and range were comparable to the Gato/Balao/Tench boats. Many of them served throughout the war. These older boats had a higher loss rate than the Gato/Balao/Tench boats, due to the length of time they were in service. Initially, one significant drawback to these pre-war boats was in the engines. Some of these boats were outfitted with 9-cylinder Hooven-Owens-Rentschler (HOR) diesels. These engines turned out not to be reliable. (The sailors thought they lived up to their name --HORs.) The main problem was the failure of the timing chains. After a while, these engines would be removed and replaced with the larger diesels being used in the Gato boats. The few S-class boats still in use at the beginning of the war were significantly smaller and had less range. That is why they became training boats as soon as we could afford to do so. They varied in size. Length was generally from about 220 ft. to 240 ft. Beam was 21 to 22 feet. Displacement was 850 tons to 903 tons on the surface. Submerged displacement was 1,060 to 1,230 tons. Maximum speed on the surface was 13 to 15 knots. Range was 5,500 nautical miles at 6.5 knots.",

    "question": "How were US submarines named in WW2?",
    "answer": "Submarines were named after sea creatures. We can't just say they were named after fish although most were, such as the *Perch*, *Bullhead*, *Cod*, *Flying* *Fish* and *Halibut*. However, some were named after marine mammals such as the *Whale*, *Porpoise*, *Finback* (a whale), *Sea Cat* (an otter) and *Sealion*. Others were named after unusual sea creatures, such as the *Seahorse* and *Skate*. Obviously, not all could be named after ferocious sea creatures such as sharks or piranhas. We even named subs the *Seadragon* and the *Trepang*, which are nudibranchs or sea slugs. The *Pampanito* is named after a smaller version of the pompano fish. Pampanito, the fish, is about a foot long. It is a rather mild-mannered fish that is brown or black on top and silver underneath.",

    "question": "How were they lost?",
    "answer": "The most frequent cause of our submarine losses was enemy action, either to aircraft, anti-submarine warship attacks or a combination of the two. Some were lost to mines. Over the course of the war, four were lost when they ran aground on reefs although those crews were all rescued. At least two boats were lost when they were struck by their own torpedoes running in a circle, likely due to gyroscope failures. The first submarine we lost in WW2, the USS *Sealion* (SS-195), was struck by bombs while being repaired in the Philippines on one of the first days of the war. In a few cases, we don't know why they were lost. It could have been enemy action, mines, torpedo circular runs or even operational errors. A few notes about unusual losses: - When the submarine USS *Pompano* (SS-181) was reported overdue, there was some confusion as to the name of the boat. It was sometimes reported in local papers as the *Pampanito*, which caused unnecessary grief for a few families until the error was corrected. - Two older boats, the USS *Salmon* (SS-182) and USS *Halibut* (SS-232) were so badly damaged that they had to be taken out of operational service. *Salmon* became a training boat. *Halibut* was just scrapped. However, they are not included in the count of 52 since they did make it home. - It has not been definitively established but the USS *Dorado* (SS-248) may have been sunk by one of our own PBM flying-boats when in a safe area. Other possible causes have been put forward as well but none have been substantiated. - The USS *Corvina* (SS-226) is the only US boat known to have been sunk by a Japanese submarine. She was lost in November of 1943. - The USS *Robalo* (SS-273) was probably sunk by a mine in 1944. 77 men died in the sinking. Apparently, four others survived, were captured and died in captivity. - The USS *Seawolf* (SS-197) was sunk in late 1944 with 82 crewmen plus 17 US Army personnel while en route to Samar. There was apparently a great deal of confusion in the area. In any case, *Seawolf* did not, or could not, respond to interrogation signals and was sunk by US forces. The summary of our submarine losses in WW2 is as follows: -------------------------- Enemy aircraft 5 ------------------- ------ Enemy ASW 16 ASW/aircraft 4 combined Bombed 1 Collision 1 Friendly fire 1 Japanese submarine 1 Mine 6 Operational 2 Own torpedo 2 Rammed 1 Ran aground 4 Shore battery 1 Unknown 7 --------------------------",

    "question": "Was everyone on board lost when a submarine sank?",
    "answer": "In WW2, that was often the case but not always. When we lost USS *S-36* (SS-141)*,* USS *S-27* (SS-132)*,* USS *S-39* (SS-141) and USS *Darter* (SS-227) because they had each run aground, all of the crews survived. The crew of the *Darter* was transferred, *en masse,* to the USS *Menhaden* (SS-377), then still under construction. Nine other boats were lost with some, but not all, of the crew surviving: - The USS *Sealion* (SS-195) was lost at the very beginning of the war in the Philippines. Four men were killed when she was hit by two bombs from an aircraft attack. The boat was in maintenance. (One man from the USS *Seadragon* (SS-194) died from the shrapnel from *Sealion.*) The rest of the crew survived and were evacuated from the Philippines. - All 62 men of the crew of the USS *Perch* (SS-313) survived the damage to their boat. They also survived the scuttling of the boat but nine died in captivity. - The USS *Grenadier* (SS-210) was damaged and then scuttled. All 76 men survived the loss of the boat, but four died in captivity. - The USS *R-12* (SS-89) was recommissioned at the beginning of the war for use as a training boat. She was still being used as a training boat when she was lost in 1943. 42 men died when the boat went down, including two Brazilian Naval Officers. Five men were rescued and, fortunately, 18 others were on liberty that day and were not on board. - The USS *S-44* (SS-155) was lost in 1943 along with 55 of her crew. Two crewmen survived. - In a very unusual case, 43 men initially survived the loss of the USS *Sculpin* (SS-191). They were picked up by the Japanese and split into two groups and put aboard Japanese carriers for the trip to Japan. One of those carriers was sunk by the submarine USS *Sailfish* (SS-192) and only one of that group of *Sculpin* sailors survived. A total of just 21 men from the *Sculpin* survived the war. Captain John Cromwell, who was aboard *Sculpin* as wolfpack commander, had opted to go down with the boat rather than taking a chance that he might give away the Ultra secrets under interrogation. He was awarded the Medal of Honor posthumously. - The USS *Tullibee* (SS-284) was sunk by her own torpedo when it made a circular run. 79 men were lost and just one survived. Approximately 23 circular torpedo runs were reported in WW2, although there could have been more. - 78 men were lost when the USS *Flier* (SS-250) was sunk by a mine. Eight others made it to Mantangula Island where they made contact with friendly natives. They radioed Australia, and the survivors were extracted by the USS *Redfin* (SS-272). - The USS *Tang* (SS-306) was hit and sunk by a circular run of her own torpedo. It was her last torpedo at the end of the patrol. Nine men survived the sinking and taken prisoner. All nine survived the war including her captain, Richard O'Kane, who was later awarded the Medal of Honor. In the other 39 cases, the entire crew went down with the boat.",

    "question": "How were they able to design such a complex ship?",
    "answer": "Submarines evolved. They didn't need to be conjured up out of someone's imagination as fully formed vessels in the 1930s and 40s. These WW2 submarines were the result of a rather lengthy process going back hundreds of years. Here is a quick summary, up to the beginning of WW2. A more detailed version of submarine history is included as Appendix 13? The idea of a submersible, naval warship appears to go back at least to the reign of Alexander the Great. That was 300 years BCE (before the common era). Leonardo De Vinci also designed a submarine, although it did not appear to be workable. The first attack in American submarine history was on a British ship during our Revolutionary War. It was attempted by David Bushnell's submarine *Turtle.* Like most of the designs at this time, *Turtle* was a small, one-man submersible powered by the man inside it. The weapon was called a torpedo but it was what we think of as a mine. It was to be attached to the target and detonated after the submersible pulled away to a safe distance. Because the speed and endurance were so limited, the attempted attack against a British ship failed. The *USS Alligator* was the first known U. S. Navy submersible, purchased during the Civil War. (The *Turtle*, above, was apparently operated by the Continental Army.) It was also small and powered by the 12 men inside, first with oars, then with a hand-cranked propeller. *Alligator* did not contribute to the Civil War effort, and sank off Cape Hatteras with no loss of life in 1863. (Wikipedia) The first successful attack by a submarine was the sinking of the *USS Housatonic.* The Confederate submarine *CSS Hunley* successfully approached the *Housatonic* and detonated the spar charge. The *Housatonic* sank. Unfortunately, the *Hunley* was not able to get far enough away and the crew was all killed when the boat sank. This was the third crew of thee *Hunley* to die when the vessel sank. A breakthrough occurred in the late 1800s. Robert Whitehead had developed his motor torpedo, a self-propelled device that was a natural fit with the submarines being built. Shortly after that, at about the turn of the century, John Holland and Simon Lake were able to create workable submarines here in the US. Their boats had gasoline engines and were no longer dependent on human power. They were larger and Holland's boats carried torpedoes. It took years but Holland was finally able to get the Navy to approve his designs and buy his submarines. These would be the first mechanically-powered attack submarines. When he ran short of capital because of all the delays, Isaac Rice came to his rescue. Rice had been looking for more applications for his battery business. Submarines were a logical application for batteries since that was their source of power when submerged. Rice bought out Holland's patents and the rest of his financial interests. Holland was eventually squeezed out of the company altogether. This was the beginning of the Electric Boat Company which still builds US submarines today. It was also the last of Holland's designs. Some nations bought Holland's boats. Others bought the designs and developed their own boats. Britain and Germany built their own submarines based on what they learned from the Holland designs and Lake's work. Many navies wanted to have their own input into the designs of their boats. Holland and Lake did their own designs and offered the boats for sale. By the time of World War I, there had been many improvements. Boats had periscopes and both bow and stern planes for depth control. They were larger. They were still somewhat primitive but more habitable. Germany, in particular, had created very effective boats. This became very apparent in September of 1914, only about six weeks into WW1, when Otto Weddigen in command of the *U-9* attacked three obsolete British cruisers in the space of about an hour. All three sank rather quickly with the loss of almost 1,500 men. Germany then proceeded to show how effective a weapon of war a submarine could be. They almost severed the supply lines to Britain and France. British ships could find German submarines with ASDIC, which we call sonar. However, they were still developing weapons to attack subs in the depths. Escorts could only hope to ram submarines or force them to the surface and attack with guns. Sometimes, it was good enough to just keep the U-boats down and unable to attack while the convoy escaped. Eventually, the Allies managed to defeat the Central Powers on land and end the war. As the spoils of war, the Allies received examples of the German U-boats. After the war, when we compared our new submarines to the German U-boats, we realized how limited our boats were. One analysis found that in every category the German submarines were superior. In many aspects they were far superior. We had no choice but to begin the work of improving our designs. The two most basic issues were the need to determine what types of submarines we should have and then finding an appropriate and effective means of propulsion for them. Some of the other challenges we had to address were the quality of periscopes, communications, detection gear (sonar) and habitability over long distances Perhaps the most important outcome of the analysis in 1926 was the creation of the Submarine Officers Conference. This was a group of experienced submarine officers that included senior commanders, naval engineers and officers who had commanded boats. For the first time, American submarine officers would have input into the needs of the submarine force and the designs of the submarines themselves. By 1934, they had settled on a design of approximately 1,500 tons surface displacement. This would provide the range needed to carry the fight across the Pacific and Atlantic if needed. The boats needed to be large enough to carry the fuel for a long journey and to carry enough torpedoes to make the trip worthwhile. This would be the eventual size of the Gato/Balao/Tench class boats of WW2, such as the *Pampanito*. The propulsion issue wasn't easily solved. The surface navy at the time was primarily steam-driven and had difficulty imagining anything else. However, steam isn't practical in a submarine dependent on fossil fuels. Restarting a steam plant after being submerged takes way too long.

The turbines are always using the steam, > and the boat is most often at a comfortable temperature. Gasoline was also impractical as a fuel source. It is too volatile; it tends to catch fire too easily and the fumes in a closed space are toxic and can be explosive. The answer came from improvements in diesel engines. Then it was a question of the cost of designing and producing these specialized engines. Fortunately, railroads were also looking for diesel engines that would fit in their locomotives and produce a similar amount of power. The railroad engines were similar enough to those for our submarines to spread development and manufacturing costs. The Submarine Officers Conference opted to design the power transfer, from the engines to the propeller shafts, as mostly electrical. On our WW2 boats, the engines are not connected physically to the propellers. They were essentially electric submarines with four large engine/generator combinations to provide the electrical power. The arrangement and the flow of power is: \\[Engine\\] \\[Generator\\] 🡪 \\[Cubicle\\] 🡪 \\[Main Motors\\] \\[Reduction Gear\\] 🡪 \\[Propellor Shaft\\] This arrangement provides multiple advantages: 1. There is no clutch to be engaged or to break down. A clutch would have been needed when diving to disconnect the engines from the propellor shafts. 2. The engines can be run at a high speed for efficiency. 3. The engines can run at a consistent speed even when the propellors need to turn slowly. 4. It allows for four engines to be installed in two separate engine rooms. 5. Four engines can provide a higher maximum speed for a larger submarine. 6. Any combination of engines can be used depending on power requirements. 7. The batteries can be recharged on a circuit separate from the one operating the boat. At this point, we had a workable design for a long-range submarine with space for sufficient fuel and weapons. It was also large enough to provide some measure of habitability for the crew. This is what we built just before and during WW2.",

    "question": "What was the primary mission of our submarines in WW2?",
    "answer": "The primary mission for our submarines was to sink Japanese shipping of all types. The early emphasis was on sinking Japanese warships and troopships, but captains were always happy to sink cargo ships and tankers as well. As mentioned in the preceding section, the original assumption was that submarines would operate with the fleet. They would be scouts and they would attack the enemy first and do as much damage as they could before the main battle fleets engaged each other. However, in hindsight, that was rather naïve. At a maximum speed of 20 or 21 knots, submarines couldn't keep up with carriers, new battleships and destroyers. Even if they could keep up, they would have to be on the surface and give away stealth, their greatest advantage and defense. Once carrier battles were fought with opponents hundreds of miles from each other, there was no practical way to have submarines accompany the fleet. > **NOTE:** The Japanese held the same view of submarines as part of the > fleet. In fact, some Japanese submarines carried aircraft (float > planes) in hangars that would be launched as scouts and recovered.

As the war progressed, we realized that tankers were the most important ships for the Japanese. If we could sink those ships, their warships and aircraft would be starved of fuel and wouldn't be able to operate effectively. Therefore, the emphasis shifted and we did sink many of the Japanese tankers. US submarines comprised only about 3% of the Navy in WW2. Yet they sank about 55% of the Japanese shipping. They did so at a cost of 52 boats. The 23% loss rate was the highest of any major American service during the war.",

    "question": "Did they do anything other than attacking enemy ships?",
    "answer": "Certainly. Submarines are very versatile ships. The fact that they can submerge and approach an assignment without being seen makes them the best vessel for many other types of missions. One of the more common missions was what was called \"lifeguard duty.\" Early in the war, someone suggested that submarines might be used to rescue our airmen whose planes were damaged in attacks on Japanese bases. Tests were successful and in 1943 we began to put submarines near Japanese bases when we attacked. Submarine captains did not like lifeguard duty. They thought they should be out sinking ships rather than hanging around on the surface in dangerous waters for a few days at a time. Naturally, the pilots had a different view. Pilots were told that, if they could not safely get back to their carriers or bases, they should try to get close to the submarines. There they would have to ditch (crash land in the water) or bail out of the plane. If they couldn't get close to the boats, the subs would try to come to them. It was helpful if a wingman could circle over the downed pilot for protection and to direct the submarine to the aviator. Lifeguard operations were very successful. Over the course of the war in the Pacific, our submarines rescued more than 500 airmen. The most famous rescued airman was a young LTJG torpedo bomber pilot by the name of George Herbert Walker Bush. He was rescued by the *USS* *Finback* in September of 1944 off the island of Chichi Jima. His crewman had been killed, and Mr. Bush was in the water for about 30 minutes before being rescued. The result was that submarines were responsible for two American presidents. (George W. Bush wasn't born until 1947.) Pampanito did lifeguard duty on her first war patrol near Yap Island. This was during the build-up to the invasion of the Mariana Islands. However, no pilots needed assistance from Pampanito on that mission. Other missions included: - Intelligence gathering, which is one of the primary missions of our submarines today. In some cases, during WW2, we needed better charts (maps). As part of their patrols, we sent submarines to certain areas to fill in gaps in our knowledge. In other cases, we needed information about the movements of Japanese ships. The most famous examples of these were the Battles of Midway, The Philippine Sea and Leyte Gulf. Submarines were able to provide critical information for the fleet and, sometimes, sink a couple enemy ships before the big battles. - Rescue of the crews of our four submarines that had run aground. - Insertion, resupply and extraction of coast watchers or guerillas on isolated islands in the Pacific. In a few instances, submarines inserted raiding parties onto Japanese held islands. Later in the war, this became more common for boats stationed at Perth, Australia. Commandoes there were anxious to carry out these raids, and found a sympathetic ear in Admiral Christie, the commander of submarines in the Southwest Pacific. Caution was the order of the day and there were concerns about intelligence losses. Many of the raids were successful. - Shelling of Japanese installations. We originally had three older submarines with two six-inch guns each, the *Argonaut*, *Nautilus* and *Narwhal* and they could be more effective on these missions. The USS *Barb* (SS-220), under the command of Gene Fluckey, had rocket launchers installed for one patrol and attacked factories, a communications hub and a shipyard which built wooden transports. The hub was hit and the shipyard was duly set ablaze. - *Barb* was also responsible for a very creative commando style attack which destroyed a train and did serious damage to the railroad track. The train was added to the *Barb's* battle flag. - Minelaying. Any submarine could be used for these missions, but the size of the USS *Argonaut* (SS-166), USS *Narwhal* (SS-167) and USS *Nautilus* (SS-168) allowed them to be more effective at this task. - Shortly after the war started, we sent a couple of submarines to the Philippines with ammunition for MacArthur and his troops. One of the boats, the USS *Trout* (SS-202), then took much of the gold and silver from the Philippine treasury off the islands to safety in the US. This resulted in a humorous story when the inventory at Pearl Harbor came up one g)old brick short. The brick was found in the galley, where the cook was using it as a paperweight holding his cookbooks open. The cook proclaimed his innocence, saying that he didn't realize what the brick was.

    "question": "What was \"Ultra\"?",
    "answer": "For most of the war, we had broken some of the Japanese naval codes. This often allowed us to know Japanese ship movements and we could deploy our submarines -- and other warships -- to attack. (Sometimes their messages were decoded too late for us to respond.) These messages were classified as top secret or \"ultra\" sensitive.

    "question": "How did we find out that submarines had been sunk?",
    "answer": "Since submarines were frequently operating alone, it would often take a while before their loss was recorded. If the boat was part of a wolfpack, the other members of the pack would likely figure out relatively soon that something was wrong. However, since there was still a chance that the problem was a communications issue, we did not immediately give up hope. The usual procedure was to identify the submarine as overdue about three weeks after it was scheduled to return to a base. After a few months, it would be declared missing and presumed lost. Families would then be notified. We might also get confirmation from the Japanese. Both sides were required to notify the other of the prisoners of war in their custody. However, the Japanese chose not to notify the U. S. of POWs in their worst and most punitive camps. These were the camps where submariners and pilots were initially assigned for interrogation and sometimes for lengthy detention. We might not know about survivors until they were transferred to less punitive camps. That could take a long time. In the worst case, we did not know about most survivors from the USS *Perch* (SS-176) until the end of the war, 1,297 days after the boat had been sunk in 1942. A reason that we withheld the information about our losses for some time was so that we were not providing useful information to the enemy. Japan claimed to have sunk more submarines than we actually had. There was no reason to provide the actual information any sooner than we had to.",

    "question": "Is it possible to escape from a sunken U. S. submarine?",
    "answer": "Yes, it is possible but only in limited circumstances. There are two escape trunks on the WW2 era boats, one in each torpedo room. The escape procedure was generally thought to be workable down to 200 feet. Experienced divers could escape from as much as 300 feet down. However, most sailors had only had experience in the 100-foot Escape Towers in New London or Pearl Harbor. Even that is in controlled circumstances with Navy divers available in case of problems. In addition, during the war, not all submarine sailors went to Sub School where they would have gone through an escape tower. Another limitation is that, inconveniently, most of the ocean is far deeper than 200 feet. Only 1 or 2% is less than 250 feet deep. The average depth of the Pacific Ocean is around 13,000 feet deep. The greatest depth is the Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench at about 36,000 feet, or seven miles. **Has anyone escaped from a submarine, of the types we built in WW2, that had sunk?** The forward escape trunk has been used twice on boats similar to the *Pampanito*. The first time was before the war when the USS *Squalus* (SS-192) went down off the East Coast in 1939. She was quickly found by her sister ship, the USS *Sculpin* (SS-191), in about 200 feet of water. The *Sculpin* radioed for help and the Navy rushed the submarine rescue ship *USS Falcon* (ASR-2) to the scene. They then used a McCann rescue bell to bring the surviving crew to the surface through the forward escape trunk. The crew in the after part of the boat died in the initial flooding. It took four trips and, despite a frayed lifting cable on the last trip, everyone else made it out. It is unclear how the flooding actually happened. When the boat was salvaged, the main induction valve was found to be open. That would certainly be enough to flood the boat. However, when the *Squalus* dove, the main induction indicator was green, showing a closed valve. In addition, in those days, submarines didn't do crash dives as was done during and after WW2. Instead, they closed up everything until they had a green board on the Christmas tree -- everything was secured. Then they would add a little pressure to the air in the boat. Only after they verified that the pressure held, confirming that everything was closed, would they actually open vents and start the dive. The *Squalus* appears to have been buttoned up for the dive. No one knows how the main induction on the *Squalus* opened after the pressure test. Because of this incident, valves were added to the air induction piping in the engine rooms. These were flapper valves that held any unwanted water in that piping and out of the engine rooms. A locking mechanism was added to the main induction to ensure it stayed closed. In addition, the divider between the engine rooms would be a hard bulkhead on future boats, instead of a soft divider. That way, flooding could be isolated to just one compartment. These upgrades would matter to the *Pampanito* on her first war patrol. > **NOTE:** The *Squalus* and *Sculpin* were sister ships, built and > often maintained at about the same time. Their histories in WW2 were > tragically intertwined. (**See the Appendix XX**.) The other time the forward escape trunk was used somewhat successfully was in 1944 when the USS *Tang* (SS-306) was sunk by a circular run of her own torpedo. *Tang* was on the surface in the South China Sea and had just fired the last torpedo she had on board. In spite of drastic turns to try to get the boat out of the way, that torpedo hit *Tang* around the after torpedo room or maneuvering. Similar to the *Squalus*, everyone aft of the control room died in the initial explosion and flooding. Of the crew on the bridge or in the conning tower, about five managed to get clear of the boat. One officer decided to swim to relatively nearby China but was never seen again. The rest of the surviving crew gathered in the forward torpedo room. Due to the severe up-angle, it was difficult to do anything about an escape. One of the survivors made it back to the control room and opened the vents on the forward ballast tanks. This put the whole boat fairly level on the bottom at around 200 feet, so the remaining crew could move about and try to escape. Only about 13 of the men actually tried to get out via the escape trunk. Some went into the escape trunk but couldn't bring themselves to try the free ascent to the surface. (Not everyone had gone through the escape tower training in New London or Pearl Harbor.) The first one out was a young ensign who, unfortunately, went too far aft of the escape door, got trapped under the deck in the superstructure and drowned. At least two others ascended too quickly and didn't get enough air out of their lungs. They died at the surface of ruptured lungs. Only six of the 13 made it to the surface safely. For some reason, the Japanese only picked up five of them. The nine rescued survivors all lived through their experiences in Japanese prisoner camps to the end of the war. However, it is estimated that the captain, Dick O'Kane, would not have survived another month in the camps. The Japanese reserved particularly harsh treatment for pilots and submariners. There is no record of anyone escaping successfully from the after torpedo room escape trunk.",

    "question": "How do the escape trunks work?",
    "answer": "The after escape trunk is one-time use only. The boat must truly be lost since this process makes it almost certain that the submarine will not surface again. In order to use the after escape trunk, the crew must: - Gather as many crewmen as possible together in the space and close the watertight door to Maneuvering. - Charge Momsen Hoods with air and distribute them. - Flood the compartment with water up to the lower lip of the escape trunk. - Pressurize the compartment to exceed the outside sea pressure if it doesn't already. At 200 feet, this would be about 90 PSI. The higher pressure in the compartment is needed to be able to open the hatch against the sea. - Launch the marker buoy. - Someone climbs up into the trunk to open the hatch (Everyone is treading water already, so no ladder is needed.) - Each man then ducks and goes out and follows the line up to the buoy. - Each man needs to exhale most of the way up to get the excess air (up to 90 PSI) out of his lungs. Yell \"ho, ho, ho\" most of the way up. - Stop at each knot in the buoy line for a minute to decompress - Do not ascend faster than your air bubbles. - At the surface, stay together, preferably near the buoy. This escape trunk has never been used successfully. The two times that sailors were able to escape from the forward trunk on a boat like this, the after part of the ship was flooded from the initial accident and everyone aft had already died. The forward escape trunk works on the same principles but holds far fewer people and can be used multiple times. The boat doesn't have to be sunk. The different steps are: - After the trunk is full with just a few men, it is flooded to just above the side door. It is pressurized, as above. That door will be used to leave the boat rather than the hatch at the top. - Exit out this side door and follow the buoy line up. - The last person out closes the door behind him. If he fails to do this, there is a long lever in the torpedo room that can be used to close the door. - The escape trunk is then drained into the torpedo room and depressurized so the next group can begin their escape. Part of the reason that this escape trunk is designed differently is so that it can be used for both exit and reentry. In WW2 divers and UDTs (underwater demolition teams) and, later, Navy SEALs could exit the boat, accomplish their missions and be recovered all without the submarine having to surface. The boat would be much less likely to be discovered. The boat and the divers are therefore safer.",

The usual speed submerged would be 2 to 3 knots. Higher speeds might be used to gain attack position. Higher speeds could be used to try to escape being attacked but that usually made more noise. Slow, silent and clever might be more effective. The ship's battery was usually rated at 48 hours if the boat was going 2 knots. The ratio of speed to power needed was cubic. Generally, if you double the speed, eight times the power was needed. If the speed was doubled from 2 to 4 knots, the battery would last approximately six hours. Double it again, and the battery likely won't last an hour. It is called the \"one-hour rate.\"",

    "question": "What does that mean? How far could they operate from San Francisco?",
    "answer": "Our submarines did not operate from the West Coast all the way to Japan or to the shipping lanes in the South China Sea. It was too far and would have taken too long just to get to the patrol area and back. There wouldn't be very much time left to find and attack Japanese ships. From the approximate mileage chart, below, you can see that it would have taken 36 days just to get from San Francisco to Japan and back. It would have taken 50 days to get to the South China Sea (using the distance to Hainan Island) and back. Home port for most of our boats was in Pearl Harbor, Oahu, Hawaii. That shortened the transit time significantly. By creating a refueling stop at Midway Island, the range of the boats was extended even further. Now, instead of taking 18 days to get to Japan from San Francisco or San Diego, it would only take nine from Midway. Instead of 25 days to get to the South China Sea, it would only take 16. The numbers in the following table are rounded approximations. Some notes regarding the table: 1. San Francisco is used as an approximation for the West Coast. The distance to Hawaii from San Diego is actually a bit greater than that from San Francisco. 2. Hainan Island, China is used as an approximation for the South China Sea. The distances to the Luzon Strait and the Formosa (Taiwan) Strait, where many of our attacks were concentrated, were somewhat shorter. 3. *Pampanito's* first war patrol was initially to Johnston Island to refuel and then to Yap in the Caroline Islands. Therefore, those distances are included. 4. On *Pampanito's* third war patrol, she rescued 73 British and Australian soldiers from the South China Sea near Hainan Island. She then proceeded at best surface speed to Saipan in the Mariana Islands where the nearest forward base was located. 5. The number of days required was estimated using 250 nautical miles per day, traveling at about 10 or 11 knots per hour. The journeys from Hawaii to Johnston Island or to Midway, and from Hainan to Saipan assume 400 miles per day. Those transits were at higher speed and an average of 17 knots per hour was used. ----------------------------------------------------------- From To Miles Nautical Days Miles ------------- -------------- -------- ------------ -------- San Francisco Tokyo 5140 4450 18 San Francisco Hainan Island 7175 6250 25 San Francisco Hawaii 2400 2100 9 Hawaii Midway 1300 1150 3 Midway Tokyo 2550 2200 9 Midway Hainan Island 4525 3900 16 Hawaii Johnston 825 725 2 Island Johnston Yap 3550 3100 13 Island Hainan Island Saipan 2350 2050 5 Saipan Hawaii 3850 3350 14 -----------------------------------------------------------",

    "question": "What if you ran out of fuel?",
    "answer": "The boats would be very careful not to. There were no fueling stations other than our forward bases and there were few of those early in the war. There was no plan to refuel at sea. Although there is no apparent documentation of a boat running out of fuel, it would have been possible to rig something up to refuel it or even tow it to the nearest base if necessary. Inside the boat, there are clusters of small black valves. Those are used to tell how much fuel is left in each of the fuel tanks. The result isn't an exact number of gallons remaining, but it is a good indication if the crew has been paying attention. They always did. The least bad thing to happen if they weren't paying attention to fuel levels, and ran out, was serious embarrassment.

    "question": "How long were war patrols?",
    "answer": "These WW2 boats were designed for war patrols of up to 75 days. A few patrols even went a bit longer. However, from what we can tell from the histories, most patrols were between 45 and 60 days each. If fuel was used quickly, because of the need to run at higher but less efficient speeds, the patrol could be shorter. If you used all your torpedoes or suffered significant damage, you would also return to port sooner. Returning to port early because you used up your torpedoes didn't always get you all of the usual break. There were instances where skippers found abundant targets and fired all their torpedoes fairly quickly. Occasionally, when those skippers returned to a base, they opted to just reload torpedoes, top off food, fuel and other supplies, and head back out quickly to finish the patrol. War patrols did appear to get shorter as the war progressed and we pushed the Japanese back to the west. We established advance bases as we defeated the Japanese. After the Battle of Midway, we could be confident enough to do maintenance and resupply at that island rather than just refueling. After defeating the Japanese in the Marianas, we established bases at Saipan and at Guam even while some Japanese soldiers were still fighting. The same was true of the Philippines. Again, there was still fighting in the islands when the tender (support ship) was established in Subic Bay. With the reduction in transit time to the combat zones, and with more and more submarines in commission, the patrols could be shorter. Generally, *Pampanito's* war patrols ranged from 42 to 59 days. However, her fifth patrol was only a bit over two weeks. (Sources differ on the exact length.) She was almost out of torpedoes and had a very short transit to her next port, Subic Bay in the Philippines.",

    "question": "How long can these submarines stay at sea?",
    "answer": "The primary limitations are food and fuel. Other things like spare parts can become an issue, but that would be an unusual case. Hopefully, running out of torpedoes is a good thing, assuming they hit targets, and aren't part of this question. Food is loaded out for the expected duration of the patrol, up to 75 days. A few patrols went a bit over 80 days. That requires creativity by the cooks and patience by the crew. The menus for the last few days would likely be strange combinations of whatever is still left on board. Fuel is the most frequent limitation. These submarines can carry up to 110,000 gallons of diesel fuel. The question then is how efficiently is it being used. A boat may have to run at higher, inefficient speeds to be in a newly assigned area. A boat may have had targets make an unexpected course change and get away. In that case, the boat may choose to make a high-speed \"end-around\" to get in front of the targets again. These are all appropriate uses of fuel, but they are less efficient. As a result, the fuel may not last as long as planned.",

    "question": "How did submarines receive messages during a patrol?",
    "answer": "Although submarines couldn't send messages over long distances, messages could be received using a very low frequency which would have a much longer range. The fleet (or Fox) broadcast would be sent from very long antennae and could reach submarines thousands of miles away. Messages in the Fox broadcast were all transmitted in a sequence and were repeated a couple times during the night. This allowed each submarine to pick off their own messages. Perhaps, they might also pick out messages for other boats in their wolfpack or in the general area to gain more information about what was going on around them. They would not attempt to acknowledge receipt unless specifically ordered to do so. Submarines did not broadcast messages using the long, low frequency antennae running along much of the length of the boat. They could only use the higher frequency, medium range radios. Their messages would often have to be relayed in order to reach commanders at Pearl Harbor, Midway or Australia. There might occasionally be a very limited amount of positive, personal information in these messages. The ship's office on the *Pampanito* displays one such message regarding the birth of a child. It appears that *Pampanito* was returning from patrol when the message was received. Generally, care was taken not to send messages with bad news since the sailor couldn't do anything about it at the time. There was no sense in distressing the sailor needlessly.",

    "question": "What kinds of messages would submarines send during a patrol?",
    "answer": "Submarines did not often transmit messages because doing so gave away their presence, and could give away their exact location. However, there was still the need to get the most important messages out. The most important messages were those regarding enemy convoys or warships that got past the submarine. This might allow other boats in the area to find the targets and attack. The message would be brief but would need to include the number and types of ships, last known base course (without zigs and zags) and estimated effective speed. Other messages could include results of attacks. These would normally be sent when the boat was clear of the attack area or in relatively safe waters. Boats would also report when they were headed back to port because they were out of torpedoes, short of fuel or had serious damage and needed to end the patrol. Submarines would also communicate with each other. This would normally be done using high frequency radios with limited range so that it would be less likely to be intercepted. Once we started operating in small wolfpacks in the fall of 1943, communications between boats became very important. Boats had to coordinate operations to be more effective. To assist with this, a radar was added to one of the periscopes with a Morse Code (telegraph) key. The radar transmission would be very directional, thus reducing the chances of it being intercepted. Another option would be to rendezvous and discuss tactics verbally.",

    "question": "Did they spend most of the time submerged?",
    "answer": "No. In fact, overall, they spent the majority of their time on the surface. When in their patrol area, they may have been submerged slightly more than they were on the surface. Early in the war, they would be up on the surface when it was dark and submerged when it was light. However, as we became better at spotting Japanese planes and ships, some captains tended to stay on the surface longer. Since we are so much faster on the surface, that would provide a better chance of being able to get in front of targets. However, the transit to and from the patrol areas was done mostly on the surface. There would be a trim dive every day, to get the boat back into neutral buoyancy. Since the transit to and from the assigned area could be a few weeks out of each patrol, mostly on the surface, the majority of the time for the full patrol is now spent on the surface.",

    "question": "What is a trim dive?",
    "answer": "The actual weight of the submarine matters a great deal when it is submerged. If it is too light, it will tend to rise and broach the surface. If it is too heavy, it will tend to go deeper, possibly to unsafe depths. Therefore, we work to keep the boat in neutral trim which is safer and makes depth control easier. We want to weigh the same as the water we displace. The challenge is that the weight of an operating submarine is constantly changing. Consuming food and using supplies make the boat lighter. Burning fuel makes the boat heavier. (See the section on diving and surfacing the submarine.) Changes in the temperature or salinity of the water can make the boat seem heavier or lighter. As a result, at least once each day, the submarine will be submerged so that the Diving Officer can get the boat back into neutral trim. That is the trim dive. It probably takes no more than 10 or 15 minutes. Once the boat is back in trim, it can be surfaced and previous operations resumed. Trim dives were most common during lengthy transits from one location to another.",

    "question": "How long were they normally submerged in the patrol area?",
    "answer": "These submarines wanted to be on the surface every night for multiple reasons if that was possible. You might come up to the surface at dusk and dive again at dawn. If you are in the tropics, the day/night split would be close to 12 hours each. However, if you were in higher or lower latitudes, the split could be much less even and you might be submerged a few hours longer in summer. That leaves less time to recharge the battery.",

    "question": "Why was it important to be on the surface at night?",
    "answer": "It was about filling the boat with fresh air, charging the battery, receiving messages and updating the ship's position -- knowing the ship's location. The air on the submarine was only intended to last 16 to 18 hours. Since most of the crew smoked, the air was probably only good for about 16 hours. (Cigarettes were given away free to servicemen in WW2.) A primary need, therefore, was to get fresh air in the boat. The battery also needed to be recharged. Fortunately, running the engines to recharge the battery pulls fresh air into the boat. Most of the air from the main induction goes directly to the engine rooms. However, some of the fresh air is fed to the ends of the boat and is pulled toward the engine rooms. That way, all compartments would get fresh air. Another task to be completed is to listen for messages on the fleet broadcast. This broadcast is sent to all submarines, and is repeated during the night. It may contain orders for the boat. It may also provide messages to other boats that would be useful for your submarine to know about. Finally, the boat would want to get a position fix. In WW2 this would be very dependent on the weather. If it were cloudy, there were no stars to shoot, and therefore no updated position fix. Ideally, there would be a clear enough sky at dawn and dusk to see the horizon and find the brightest stars as they appear. The elevations of those stars would be measured with a sextant. The resulting numbers could then be translated into your position. Sun lines at local apparent noon could help update the boat's position but wouldn't usually be as accurate as a star fix. Sun lines could be done through the periscope.",

    "question": "How long could these submarines stay submerged?",
    "answer": "It depends. Submarines could stay submerged for more than the 16 hours that the fresh air would last, as indicated above, but it takes some extra steps. The short answer is that the practical limit would be around 30 hours. However, the record in WW2 was just short of 38 hours by the USS *Puffer* (SS-268). At that point both the battery and the crew were pretty messed up. (Technical term!) The boat was being depth charged and tracked, and they had no choice. Fortunately, they were eventually able to get away and return to base. There are two limitations at play here, battery power and air quality. The limits on both depend on how fast you use them. As discussed above, battery duration depends very much on the speed. At two knots (about 2.3 miles per hour), the battery is rated at 48 hours. Note that you probably walk faster than that. If you double the speed to four knots, you need to divide the time the battery would last by about eight. (The ratio of speed to battery power is cubic, two times two times two.) If you double the speed again to eight knots, you divide the time by eight again and the battery will last less than an hour, and this is called the \"one-hour rate\". At maximum speed submerged, about 9 ½ knots, the battery may only last about 30 to 40 minutes. As a result, captains tended to use the battery very conservatively. Air quality also depends somewhat on how fast you use it, although the differences aren't as drastic. Again, the air in the boat was intended to last 16 to 18 hours. However, since most of the crew in WW2 smoked, the air would likely last 16 hours. How can you use it more slowly? One way is to put everyone not actively operating the boat in their bunks. Expending less energy uses less oxygen. Another way would be to put the smoking lamp out. That didn't usually turn out to be practical due to nicotine addiction. Still, it could be done in a real emergency. Fortunately, there are some other options to extend the air limitation. There are six oxygen bottles on the *Pampanito*, and they could be bled into the boat to drive up the O2 percentage. There are also many cannisters in the overhead marked \"Do Not Paint.\" These contain lithium hydroxide, soda lime, which is a CO2 absorbent. The cannisters would be opened and spread on bunks or decks. However, the chemicals are caustic. These steps will add a couple hours of habitable air to the boat. If more time is needed after the above steps, it is possible to bleed air into the boat from the high-pressure air banks. It seems unlikely that any boat had to go to this extreme but it is possible to safely double the air pressure in the boat. The oxygen and CO2 percentages are about half way back to normal and the pressure is not extreme. The pressure would be about the same as swimming at about 25 feet. This wouldn't be terribly uncomfortable and wouldn't require decompression. However, now another challenge arises due to the increased pressure. When the boat surfaces, we want eyes on the bridge as soon as possible. We need to know for sure that there isn't anything up there that we missed on sonar and periscope sweeps. Although there isn't a great overpressure in the boat, that increased pressure is in all of the pressure hull that is 16 feet in diameter and about 275 feet long. It all wants to go out the Bridge hatch at once. If you put a man in that small hatch, he could be pushed out much the way a bullet is pushed down the barrel of a gun, albeit more slowly. To keep him from being launched, they would have a big sailor hang on to his ankles as he opens the hatch. Really! The procedure was not uncommon. The overpressure could be an issue just from launching multiple torpedoes which brings more air and water into the boat. There are some other steps that could be taken to reduce the pressure in the boat such as running the low-pressure blower or the air compressors. However, that would usually take too much time and you don't want to introduce a vacuum.",

    "question": "How do you know that oxygen is getting low?",
    "answer": "Even without a gauge of some sort, there are signs that oxygen is getting low. Probably the first would be labored breathing. Men would have to breathe deep in order to get enough oxygen into their lungs. This gets to be the feeling that there is an elephant sitting on your chest. Added to that would be headaches among the crew. They can be pretty intense and painful when oxygen is very low. Another indicator is that the air no longer supports combustion. It becomes impossible to light a cigarette because the match or lighter can't burn. This puts the \"smoking lamp\" out and slows the rate of oxygen consumption ever so slightly. There is still free oxygen in the air, but the level has definitely decreased. It would certainly be time to do something about the poor air in the boat.",

    "answer": "This may seem to be a laughable question. However, it isn't like asking about screen doors on a submarine, which there obviously aren't. After all, it looks to many people as though there are a whole series of windows along the side of the boat. Those are actually limber holes, not windows, and they are discussed under \"Diving, Surfacing and Buoyancy.\" In fact, there is just one small window on the Pampanito. (This is in addition to the periscopes.) It is located in the control room at the Chief of the Watch station. Near the Christmas tree, in the forward port corner, there is a safe and a ladder above it leading up to a hatch. That hatch has a small window in it, about two inches in diameter. The purpose of the window is to let the gun crews know when the water has cleared enough to be able to open the hatch safely and head up on deck.",

    "question": "Why was the submarine service known as the \"Silent Service\"",
    "answer": "Silence, or being quiet, was a fact of life on submarines. In WW2, it could mean the difference between making it home or being lost at sea. Modern submarines are still designed to be as quiet as possible. That doesn't mean you can't talk, but you surely didn't want to drop a wrench. The lack of publicity about our submarines was a great advantage. Sailors' lives could be saved if the enemy was kept in the dark about capabilities and intended operations. Large fleets with frequent communications could be difficult to disguise or hide. It was much easier for submarines. They could submerge and severely limit radio and radar emissions. When attacking the enemy or evading attack, being quiet was even more important. The enemy's use of sonar was how submarines could be located. Quiet boats were harder to find. There were routines to run more quietly by shutting off as much equipment as possible. Where possible, hydraulic systems, such as the bow and stern planes, were operated manually to avoid the noise of the pumps. Even fans would be shut off to lower the noise level in the boat as much as possible. Submarines took various steps to keep hidden when on patrol. They were very aware of the dangers of using radar often. The Japanese were listening and could locate a submarine by listening for their radars. Boats even learned to sink their trash so that it couldn't be found by the Japanese. Steps such as these deprived the enemy of a great deal of information. \"Silence is golden.\"",

    "question": "Why did submarines limit the use of active sonar and radar?",
    "answer": "The main reason is that they give away your presence and location long before they provide information that is useful to you. For example, let us assume that the effective range of radar was no more than seven miles early in the war. That means that the radar pulse is strong enough to travel 14 miles -- to the enemy ship or plane and back. The issue is that all of the radar pulses being sent out, that don't hit a target and return, are going to travel out 14 miles. That means that the enemy can be aware of your presence when they are still 14 miles away but you won't be aware of them until are within seven miles.",

    "question": "Does that mean submarines never used active sonar and radar?",
    "answer": "Not necessarily. It meant that they used it sparingly and cautiously. You would always be listening on sonar, but it has always been very rare to use the active mode, to send out search pulses. That may be even more true today as passive sonar has improved so much. For reference, recall the scene in \"The Hunt for Red October\" where the captain asks his second in command to send out a second \"single ping\". The second in command looks at the captain in total disbelief. The movie is fiction, but that part of it, and much more, is quite accurate. In WW2, active radar was used by submarines more often than active sonar. Aircraft were a main concern. An air search radar was available early in the war. It didn't provide much information beyond the presence of an aircraft. It was also on a frequency that the Japanese could easily detect. Since the information was still important, captains would use the air search radar very sparingly. When a new surface search radar became available, and it included some aircraft detection, it was used more often. However, it was still used sparingly and often wasn't trusted to locate aircraft in the area. (Refer to section 65 on electronics for more information.) Late in the war, a radar was added to the search periscope to provide accurate range information. This would be a narrow beam and a single pulse making it hard to determine the location of the source. More importantly, it was a different frequency, making it that much less likely that the enemy was listening for it.",

    "question": "Did loose lips really sink ships?",
    "answer": "There was a saying and many posters during WW2 that \"Loose Lips Sink Ships.\" It reminded everyone that intelligence matters a great deal during war, and you never know who might be listening. Certainly, information about major fleet and troop movements mattered a great deal. However, does that mean that we may have actually lost ships due to \"loose lips?\" Admiral Lockwood, commander of submarines in the Central Pacific, believed there was at least one time when we did. In June of 1943, US Congressman Andrew Jackson May of Kentucky was Chair of the House Military Affairs Committee. He held a press conference on returning from a war zone junket. He let it be known that our boats were able to evade Japanese depth charges because they would explode at shallow depths. Early in the war, the Japanese depth charges had only two settings, 30 meters (98 feet) and 60 meters (197 feet.) Even our pre-war classes, which were 250-foot (depth) boats, could get far enough below that to avoid major damage. The Japanese weren't nearly as stupid as we wanted to believe early in WW2. They did pick up this information from Congressman May. Then they modified their depth charges to add depth settings for 90 and 120 meters as well. In the next few months, we lost more boats than usual. Admiral Lockwood believed that Congressman May's \"loose lips\" cost us as many as ten boats and 800 men. Representative May did not suffer any serious consequences for his security breach. However, he failed to win reelection in 1946 and spent nine months in prison for unrelated bribery charges. He was pardoned by President Truman in 1952 but was unable to revive his political career.",

    "question": "How is the trash and sewage removed from the boat?",
    "answer": "In WW2, trash and garbage were usually thrown over the side when at sea for an extended time. The trash would be bagged and weighted so that it would sink to the bottom. The objective was to be sure that the trash didn't give away the boat's identity or location. This also meant that someone had to come up on deck the throw the trash over the side. That could be dangerous and in heavy seas the trash would be retained in the boat until the seas calmed. For sewage, we are talking about the human waste that goes through the heads (toilets). The sanitary tanks for three of the heads were emptied overboard each morning, usually between 05:00 and 06:00. High pressure air is used to blow the tanks dry. This is done by the auxiliaryman who is part of the engineering department. It is critical that the sanitary tanks then be vented to eliminate air pressure. Failure to do so results in a very nasty surprise to the next person flushing the head. The head in the after torpedo room is different. This head flushes directly overboard since there is no room for a sanitary tank below the deck. (The propellor shafts are below that space.) The challenge is that the water level outside the boat is above the top of the torpedo tubes while the toilet is maybe a foot and a half off the deck. The toilet sits well below the outside water level. The issue then is: how do you flush a head uphill without the contents and seawater coming back into the boat? You do that by first moving the contents to a small intermediate tank. It is a multi-step process to flush this head. And if you get it wrong, **you** get to clean up the mess. The basic process is: - Shut the bowl flapper valve - Add water to the bowl through the sea and stop valves - Shut both valves - After using the head, operate the flapper valve to empty the contents of the bowl into the intermediate chamber - Shut the flapper valve - Charge the volume tank until the pressure is 10 pounds higher than the sea pressure - Open the gate and plug valves on the discharge line - Operate the rocker valve to discharge the contents of the expulsion chamber overboard. - Shut the gate and plug valves. - Vent any remaining pressure. The process works but is not for the faint of heart. By the way, this head would only be used when on the surface and not at all when in port. Current environmental regulations require that ships no longer discharge waste into harbors. Therefore, modern submarines need to have holding-tanks for all heads and a means to discharge the tanks to a sewage treatment system when in port.",

    "question": "When would the signal tube in the after torpedo room be used?",
    "answer": "If it were needed for signaling, we would launch flares from that tube. This would be used mostly when doing training exercises with other U. S. ships and planes. The color of the flare contains the message. For example: - A green flare is fired by the submarine when the boat would have launched torpedoes if this weren't an exercise. That would mean that the boat had sunk the carrier or tanker, etc. - A red flare is fired by the submarine when it is in trouble and needs to surface quickly. All surface ships need to get clear of the area as soon as possible. The signal tube can also be used to launch decoys. Modern decoys are sophisticated and complex. In submarines like the *Pampanito*, the countermeasure is fairly basic. It consists of a bubble generator, much like the German *pillenwerfer*, made of calcium hydride. When it contacts water, it generates a large volume of bubbles. Air bubbles reflect sound (sonar) just as the submarine's hull would. It is the change in density that reflects the sound. If you are familiar with Alka Seltzer, you know that it reacts with water and creates fizz or bubbles. The countermeasures are similar. (However, Alka Seltzer uses different chemicals, bicarbonates.) A fictional example can be seen in the movie \"The Hunt for Red October.\" When the Russian aircraft drops a torpedo to try to sink \"Red October,\" the boat releases a pair of decoys that tumble and generate bubbles in an attempt to confuse the torpedo's sonar. Some modern decoys can be much more sophisticated. They would be launched from a torpedo tube and generate noises just like another submarine. That includes the power plant noises as well as propellors, pumps and other sounds that submarines normally make. They do a much better job of providing another \"target\" and confusing the other guys sonar.",

    "answer": "There were specific colors and patterns for most Navy ships. For surface ships, this can be fairly complex. Patterns can act as camouflage and can even confuse the eye about which direction the ship is going. Paint colors also mattered to submarines. They wanted to be less visible on the surface. Initially, submarines were all black. This was thought to be the best color when on the surface at night as well as when submerged. That turned out not to be the case. Black was the best color for horizontal surfaces. Seen from above, the deck and other surfaces can blend in with the depths of the ocean. Those surfaces remained black in the new paint schemes. The vertical surfaces of the submarine were a different matter. Someone pointed out that black is actually too dark at night. Submarine captains were skeptical, but experiments were done to determine which shade of dark grey would be less visible. Captains were convinced when they saw that a dark grey submarine was actually harder to spot than a black one. Submarines were painted all black again once snorkels were added and boats could be submerged most of the time. > **NOTE**: There is an old Navy adage: If something moves, salute it; > if it doesn't move, move it; if you can't move it, paint it gray.",

Unfortunately, the devices would be stopped as well; they would no longer rotate. The small amount of water that is leaking into the boat also acts as a lubricant.

During the last year or so of the war, that number gradually increased to 85. The fleet boats from the 1930s had slightly fewer than 80 crewmen on board. The earlier S-boats had far fewer men on board. However, they were generally no longer in active combat by the last year of the war. **Why weren't the Gato/Balao/Tench boats designed for the number of men assigned?** Actually, they had been. These submarines were originally expected have 70 men on board to operate the equipment available when they were designed. However, new equipment -- often electronics - was added even before the war. Then we realized that we would require more than 70 men in a crew. Soon after the war started, a crew of 80 men became the standard. Although the number of men in the crew increased, the basic design of the boats didn't change. At that point, there was simply no place to put additional bunks. It was the equipment added later, and the men needed to operate it, that caused the shortage of bunks.",

    "question": "Why did the number increase in the last year?",
    "answer": "The best estimates are that it was due to the addition of the second 40 mm Bofors gun or possibly because of added electronics or other equipment. However, confirmation of these reasons is hard to find. We expected to have to invade Japan in order to force a surrender. After what we saw in the Pacific island-hopping campaign, we couldn't expect Japan to surrender without a desperate, even suicidal, fight. We knew that an invasion would be a very costly undertaking in both men and ships. We expected that the fleet would be harassed constantly by *Kamikaze* aircraft and suicide boats. Our submarines were likely to be assigned as pickets to warn and help defend the fleet. Therefore, a second 40 mm Bofors was added to many boats. The increased staffing may have been for that gun. Fortunately, Japan surrendered after the second atomic bomb was dropped and we no longer needed to invade. Throughout the war, new equipment was added to the boats to make them more effective. That new gear often needed more operators and maintenance. That was particularly true of the new radars and sonars as well as navigation equipment such as the new LORAN.",

    "question": "Why does it take so many men to staff the submarine?",
    "answer": "On the surface at sea, there were a number of jobs to do and there would be one person awake in each compartment to monitor the space for problems or danger. For example, on the surface there would be - The officer of the deck with three or four lookouts on the bridge. - A helmsman, quartermaster (navigation) along with the sonar and radar operators in the conning tower. - The Chief of the Watch plus an IC electrician and a messenger in the control room. - A radar operator for the air search and IFF equipment. - A radioman on watch in the radio room. - Two electrician mates in maneuvering. - A motor machinist mate (engineman) and an oiler in each engine room. - Normally there would be a cook in the crew's mess. There would often be a mess cook there too. - A steward mate in the forward battery. - A torpedoman on watch in each torpedo room. - There are other duties, such as an electrician monitoring the battery, particularly during a charge. - A gunner's mate to maintain the guns This is a total of about 24 per shift, and there are three shifts. When submerged, the duties for some of these men would change. For example, the officer of the deck (OOD) will become the diving officer and there would be a new OOD in the conning tower. The oilers in the engine rooms will man the trim manifold and air manifold in the control room. The lookouts would man the bow and stern planes. In total, you will need about the same number of men when submerged as on the surface. You need to have additional personnel on board to allow for trainees, injuries and illness. Gun crews will also need to be staffed during battle stations. In addition to these functions, there are the captain, the XO, the yeoman and pharmacist mate who generally aren't on the watch list. The yeoman and the pharmacist mate might stand some watches as their primary duties permit. **Since submarines had limited space, were there height and weight limits?** There was a height limit on these boats. During WW2, it was six feet, four inches or 1.93 meters. That means two things. First, if you are six feet or taller, you probably won't be able to stretch out on your bunk. You will sleep on your side curled up a bit. Second, it means there are multiple obstructions available for you to locate with your head. In that case, some important medical advice applies: if it hurts when you do that, don't do that. A tall crew member who has been on a submarine even for a short while may appear to pay no attention to those painful obstacles, but he has already located them all - and not all the hard way. Submariners tend to be reasonably bright. Location memory helps. In the dark in your home, you know where the furniture is and you avoid it. Unless, of course, someone has just added something or rearranged everything. Weight was a different issue. There were weight limits, adjusted for height, to be met when joining the Navy. During WW2, there were no official limits after that. However, there might be informal pressure if you carried too much weight. You might not want to struggle through the watertight doors if you were seriously overweight. There have also been reports that the stench on the boats tended to suppress appetites. At some point after the war, the rules changed. You then had to under the weight limits each time you reenlisted. Those were the maximums. The minimum height and weight limits applied to everyone in the Navy when enlisting. There were no separate requirements for submarine service.",

    "question": "Does that mean you wanted all smaller sailors on a submarine?",
    "answer": "Not really. It might be helpful to have some smaller sailors who could get into tight spaces to do some of the maintenance work. However, you needed some bigger men to push (technically to pull with pulleys and ropes) the 3,200-pound torpedoes into the tubes. You may also need someone to lift the heavy cylinder liners for the engines into place. The shells for the 5-inch gun weighed over 70 pounds. In short, you do want a number of good-sized sailors in the crew to do some of the heavy lifting and pulling. The result is that you would have men of various sizes in the crew. It probably reflected the variety of the population in general, although with fewer basketball players. **With all the negatives, why would anyone want to be on a submarine in WW2?** Certainly, life on a diesel submarine can be primitive. The boats stink, they are cramped, they don't ride on the ocean well and you may not get a full shower during the entire patrol. You may not see the sky for weeks at a time. Even if you were a lookout, you still may not see the sun for weeks since the boats were often submerged during daylight while in the patrol area. Diesel boats can be pretty unpleasant. Still, sub sailors did think it was good duty. There were many advantages in being aboard a submarine. Those advantages are different in peacetime than they were in WW2, but there were and still are many reasons to volunteer. During WW2, the main advantages appear to have been: - In many cases, the biggest attraction was probably the extra submarine pay. That appears to be about 50% added to the base pay for sub sailors, at least for the junior ranks. This was very important to sailors when the country was just coming out of the Great Depression. This extra pay would often be sent home and could be very helpful to their families. - Submarines were the only ships that could take the fight back to the Japanese early in the war. Even as the war progressed, it would take a while for the rest of the Navy to take the fight to Japanese waters. There was a real desire to avenge the attack on Pearl Harbor, and service on submarines was the quickest way to start getting even. There were the occasional attacks on the Japanese islands, such as the Doolittle/Halsey air raid on Tokyo. However, submarines could provide a more sustained attack. - This may seem a bit morbid, but some men thought that the worst thing that could happen to them was to come home maimed. Submariners, on the other hand, were less likely to lose an arm or a leg. The odds were greater that they wouldn't come home at all, but they weren't likely to come home maimed. For some sailors, that was preferable. Some advantages still apply: - The crews are better. There were usually more volunteers for submarines than there were billets (positions) available. Naturally, the submarine service took the best available. Currently, reports are that you have to be in the top 15 to 20% of the Navy to be considered for submarines. That is true even for non-nuclear positions such as storekeepers, yeomen (admin) and cooks. - Submariners were -- and are -- an elite group. It was a chance to be part of something special. - The work is more interesting. You often operate independently and without much direction from above or afar. Sailors on our current submarines commonly cannot talk about much of what they did. Even the old boats could be doing interesting work such as training with Navy SEALS or Recon Marines, or just practicing intelligence gathering and photo reconnaissance. - You can learn something new nearly every day. Sailing a submarine in three dimensions is more complex, challenging and interesting. - Submarines are generally less formal than surface ships. - Submarine duty could be a faster route for promotions. For officers, it could be a faster route to commanding your own ship. (This is no longer true since the advent of nuclear power.)",

    "question": "How was a submarine less formal?",
    "answer": "The main factor is that there isn't enough room for formality. Uniforms might be less uniform. On long patrols in the tropics, \"uniforms\" became very relaxed. In WW2 submarines, shaving generally wasn't required. There was more banter and informal conversations. In quiet times, there would be verbal rehearsals for equipment failures or casualties. All of this was usually acceptable as long as everyone was also paying attention to their tasks and doing them well. Another example is that \"officers' country\" can't be avoided as it can on a surface ship. There is only one level that can be used to get through the boat. The crew has work to do or meals to eat that require passing through the officers' and chiefs' berthing in the forward battery. However, being less formal did not mean that the officers or crew were disrespectful or less precise when doing their jobs.",

    "question": "What was the worst part of being on a boat?",
    "answer": "During WW2, the worst thing was, obviously, being attacked by depth charges, bombs or guns. It is impossible to truly explain what it was like to someone who didn't experience it first-hand. Depth charging has been described as like being in a drum that is being hit by a large hammer. The difference is that your life is in immediate danger, and your job is to be still and be quiet. The crew could hear the attacking ship -- even without the aid of sonar -- and could often hear the depth charges as they hit the water. If the depth charges were close enough, they would hear the click of the detonators right before they exploded. After that, the worst part could be the smell, inability to shower often enough, close quarters, lack of exercise or lack of sunshine. It depends on what is most important to you.",

    "answer": "There is a fair amount of variation here, but it appears that a man would typically be assigned to the same boat for about 15 to 18 months of combat. The *Pampanito's* war patrols covered a period of 13 months and just 30 of her original crew made all six patrols. That would be consistent with about 15% of the crew rotating off after each patrol. In peacetime, men and women are typically assigned to the same ship for two to three years. Again, there can be a fair amount of variation.",

    "answer": "Not very often. The needs of the war came first. Sailors might get a chance for leave and travel home when reassigned to another boat, particularly if it was to new construction. They would also get some leave during shipyard overhauls. During an overhaul, captains would try to give half the crew off at a time, usually starting with the married men whose wives were not nearby. Then the rest of the crew would get their chance to go home for a while. All of this was true of the rest of the Navy as well.",

    "question": "How were submarine sailors selected?",
    "answer": "Normally, the first requirement is that you have to volunteer. You have to be odd enough to want to be on a submarine. (We like to say that submariners' brains are wired differently.) When someone offered you an opportunity to be stuffed into a 16-foot diameter pipe with 79 of your closest friends and then go down 400 feet or more below the surface of the ocean, that had to sound like a good idea. In fact, you usually had to ask to be a submariner. The next step is that you have to be selected as a candidate. There are actually more volunteers than there are billets (positions or spaces) in submarines. As a result, the submarine force gets their pick of candidates. This is one of the reasons that submarine crews tend to be better than the average in the rest of the Navy. Finally, the selected candidates are screened for even temperaments. There would be psychological testing if the Navy hasn't already had a lengthy opportunity to observe you. The Submarine Force is looking for men (and now women) who are even tempered, who will \"take an even strain.\" Which candidates get along well with others and pitch in when there is extra work to do? Who will be a strong part of the team when a challenge, emergency or crisis arises.",

    "question": "Was everyone a volunteer?",
    "answer": "Traditionally, everyone aboard a U. S. submarine is a volunteer. That has almost always been the case. The exception was early in WW2 when the submarine force needed to expand quickly. Some sub sailors at that time didn't remember when they volunteered. (We like to say that they didn't back up quickly enough when volunteers were asked for or that they were \"voluntold.\") However, if you don't want to be on a submarine, you don't have to. We probably don't want you to be aboard if you aren't comfortable there. You can always request to \"non-vol\", even if you volunteered in the first place. Being at sea in such close quarters and submerged for so much time can be very different from just a training dive or two. It might be much more uncomfortable than you imagined. The Navy can always find another place for a quality, competent sailor to serve.",

    "question": "How does one volunteer for submarines?",
    "answer": "Prior to WW2, an officer had to serve for two years on a surface ship before he could volunteer at all. However, that requirement ended during the war. The first requirement is still that you have to be odd enough to think that you will enjoy being confined in a small space and underwater for significant periods of time. If so, then you submit your request for submarine service normally through your superiors and then your commanding officer. The next step is to pass the preliminary selection. There are more volunteers than billets (spaces) available, so the submarine force gets their choice. Selection depends your demonstrated skills and maybe on your specialty. The next step is to determine your ability to get along. For volunteers new to the Navy, this consists of psychological screening. The submarine service is looking for sailors who can be a teammate with an \"even strain.\" Someone who is in your face (either angry or happy) or too retiring will not qualify. You need to be able to enjoy the banter and mild pranks of your shipmates while working hard as a team when needed. Officers who come through the Naval Academy or Navy Reserve Officer Training Corps (NROTC) programs are already well known to the Navy and are not normally screened again for sub duty. However, screening for nuclear power billets in submarines or carriers is done and is even more rigorous.",

    "question": "What kind of training did they get for submarine duty?",
    "answer": "The usual program for diesel submarines was three months of sub school in New London for enlisted crew and six months for officers. This was in addition to any training for the enlisted crew in their ratings (specialties.) Once you got to your submarine, the training began in earnest. During WW2, the training in sub school was condensed and sometimes skipped completely. If you went to sub school, it would be about half the normal time or about six weeks for enlisted men and three months for officers. For experienced sailors, sub school may be skipped altogether. > NOTE: The process for submarine school has changed, particularly for > those who have been nuclear-trained. They will likely be sent to their > boats after nuclear power school but without sub school so that the > nuclear training doesn't erode before they can use it. When you got to your submarine, it was assumed that you actually knew very little. In fact, that was correct in that you had little practical experience. Your first job would be to become a qualified watchstander so you could start to carry your share of the workload. The next thing would be to earn your dolphins, to qualify for duty in submarines. Qualifying usually required at least six months for enlisted men and at least a year for officers. You had to demonstrate your knowledge of all the basic systems on the boat. For an enlisted sailor, this would mean passing an oral exam while going through the boat with the Chief of the boat (COB) and then with the commanding officer or executive officer. An officer would qualify on another, similar submarine. The process would include rigging the boat for dive, diving the boat and conducting a practice attack. The key thing about submarines is that you need to be able to respond quickly to any emergency. There are no damage control parties on a boat. It is up to whoever is in the space to respond and resolve an emergency. In order to do that, you need to know the systems in any space.",

    "question": "Did anyone stress out and need to get out of submarines?",
    "answer": "During the war, there are a few instances of sailors stressing out when under attack. However, they were surprisingly few considering the stress of being depth charged. In a few cases, the sailor might start yelling or trying to open a hatch to get out. In these cases, he would be forcibly subdued and then sedated. He might have to be knocked unconscious to render him quiet. He would usually remain sedated until returning to port. In a few other cases, the sailors froze and became very withdrawn, almost catatonic. In those cases, they might simply be relieved of their duties and replaced. Sailors almost never stressed out just by being submerged. There are very few, if any, cases like this in the literature. After all, you had volunteered to be under water. If you thought there was any chance you might be claustrophobic, you weren't likely to volunteer for submarines.",

These medics, called pharmacist mates at the time, were specially trained and qualified for independent duty and they were very good. They understood the art of medicine as well as the science. They were very good at diagnosis and treatment. *Pampanito* did have a doctor on board briefly. On her third war patrol, when she was headed to Saipan with the rescued British and Australian soldiers, she was met by a destroyer. A doctor and another pharmacist mate were transferred to the boat to help with the weaker soldiers. Unfortunately, the doctor appears to have spent most of his time doing paperwork and complaining that *Pampanito* didn't have enough fresh citrus fruit on board to prevent scurvy. There are still no doctors on our attack submarines. The large missile boats are the only US subs with doctors on board at this time.",

    "question": "What did the pharmacist mates treat?",
    "answer": "The main things that WW2 medics would treat would be minor injuries, a few broken bones, skin rashes, etc. A few needed to treat bullet wounds from surface attacks with guns; the enemy did tend to shoot back. There would probably be a few cases of venereal disease as well. Colds and flu were relatively uncommon on submarines during WW2. Most sailors hadn't had a chance to go home and be exposed to children who tend to spread such illnesses. If there was a cold or flu on board, it would probably spread rapidly because of the close living conditions and then die out. They did not expect to treat men with tropical diseases like those of the rescued POWs. **As a result, does that mean there were no surgeries on submarines in WW2?** Not completely true. In addition to the cuts, bruises, broken bones and routine illnesses, the medics handled many emergency issues that came up. For example, there were three known appendectomies done on boats so they could stay on patrol. The first one was done on the *Seadragon* in 1942. The patient was in great pain and the medic thought he could do the surgery. The patient gave his consent. The operation took two and a half hours was done \"by the book\" with the medic following the descriptions and diagrams in his medical books. The patient recovered fully. A few notes: - The surgery was done submerged, at 120 feet, to provide a steady platform. - It was done on the wardroom table with the Executive Officer as the chief assistant. - Ether was used as the anesthetic which can be dangerous in the closed spaces of a submerged submarine with no access to fresh air. - Some instruments had to be devised from wardroom silverware. For example, a tea strainer was used as a mask to administer the ether and bent spoons were retractors. In late 1942, successful appendectomies were also performed on the *Grayback* and on the *Silversides*. After that, the Navy issued orders that pharmacist mates were not to perform any further appendectomies. It would seem unlikely that there were no more cases of appendicitis on board submarines, but there do not appear to be any records of other surgeries.",

Although women have served in the Navy since 1917, when Loretta Walsh became the first women to enlist, they couldn't serve on ships or in combat in WW2.

Offenses that were serious might warrant confinement rarely, if ever, happened on a submarine during WW2. Besides, how could you physically punish someone worse than putting him on a submarine in combat -- where he already was? However, there was an occasional need to confine someone. That would usually be a Japanese POW, although that didn't happen very often. Japanese soldiers and sailors would usually swim away from a rescue. It was too dishonorable to be captured. The few that were taken aboard, for intelligence purposes, would just be handcuffed to a bunk. Sometimes, the captured POW would want to contribute to the boat by helping with the cleaning. If the captain and crew believed that the POW was reliable enough, they would remove the handcuffs and let him help. The assumption would be that if a crewmember needed to be confined, it would be easy enough to cuff him to a bunk for the rest of the patrol.",

The Chief of the Boat, or COB, is the go-between for the captain and XO and the enlisted crew. Although the COB is not an officer, he or she is treated as the third most senior person on board. The COB monitors morale and is a key part of training the crew in submarine qualifications. The COB defuses situations before they require formal punishment and may impose modest, informal punishment to keep issues off the record. This position has a long history on submarines and, in the early 1970's, was implemented throughout the military as command master chiefs or command master sergeants. In WW2, the COB was appointed by the CO and XO. They would select the chief who had the best leadership qualities. Currently, being a COB is a career track. The Navy offers specific training and qualifications. The COB is now appointed by the Navy, similar to the way the CO and XO are assigned. The COB is part of the command team and reaps the rewards for the success of the whole boat, as well as the discipline for significant failures.",

    "question": "Who are the petty officers who aren't chiefs?",
    "answer": "These are the specialists who are assigned to submarines and are proficient in a certain area of expertise. Petty officers in increasing seniority are third class, second class and first class. As they rise in rank, they will have qualified as having increasing technical knowledge and leadership ability. That also means they will have positions of greater responsibility, such as being responsible for a torpedo room or an engine room.",

    "question": "What specialists (ratings) were typically assigned to submarines?",
    "answer": "These are the typical ratings for these submarines in WW2. Since then, the names of some ratings have changed. For example, motor machinist mates became enginemen. Pharmacist mates became hospital corpsmen. Another rating, gunner's mate, became no longer applicable to submarines when the guns were removed in the early '50s. However, missile techs have been added to submarines with Tomahawk or Polaris/Poseidon/Trident missiles. - Cook -- prepares and cooks the meals. The overnight cook is the baker who makes bread, rolls, cakes and pies. The senior cook works with the supply officer to plan meals and order the necessary foods. - Electrician mate -- responsible for maintaining electrical circuits and operating the cubicle in the maneuvering room. Also responsible for maintaining the battery cells, checking the specific gravity (estimating the power remaining) and adding pure water when needed. - Fireman -- not yet a specialist, but a young sailor who is assigned to engineering and will eventually pursue a specific rating in that area. - Gunner's mate -- responsible for maintaining and operating the guns. Some of this work regarding the guns would be done by the torpedomen. - IC electrician -- responsible for interior communications equipment including signaling systems. - Machinist mate - responsible for mechanical systems other than the engines, such as the air conditioning, pumps, motors and mechanical systems other than the main engines. - Motor mac -- a motor machinist mate, responsible for the operation, maintenance and repair of the four main engines and the smaller \"donkey\" diesel which is in the lower level of the after engine room. - Pharmacists mate -- the \"medic\" who cares for his shipmates' illnesses and injuries. These men were specially selected and trained for independent duty since there was no physician aboard the boats. - Quartermaster -- responsible for navigation and signaling between ships. Since submarines were often operating independently, signaling wasn't often required. Assists the navigator and tracks the ship's position between fixes. - Radioman -- responsible for sending and receiving messages as well as maintaining and repairing the radio equipment. Routes messages to the captain and other officers as appropriate. Alerts the Communications officer when highly classified messages need additional decoding. Responsible for keeping the crypto codes secure while in use. - Seaman -- similar to a fireman, not yet a specialist, but a young sailor who is assigned to an operations department and will eventually pursue a specific rating in that area. - Sonarman -- responsible for operating, maintaining and repairing the sonar equipment. Listens for the sounds of other ships in the area and alerts the Officer of the deck (OOD) to any unusual or unexpected sounds. - Stewards mate -- supports the officers; staffs the serving galley; provides the captain with coffee; etc. - Storekeeper -- works with the supply officer to submit the forms to obtain the food, spare parts and other materials needed by the boat. - Torpedoman -- responsible for maintaining and repairing the torpedoes on the boat. May have been part of the gun crews. Maintained the charge in the electric torpedoes. Maintained the torpedo tubes and associated equipment. - Yeoman -- administrative assistant. Maintained the records for assigned personnel and for other records for the boat. An example would be the patrol reports as directed by the captain. - Mess cooks -- these would normally be the newest and most junior members of the crew assigned to assist the cooks. They were most often seamen or firemen who have not yet been assigned to departments. (Mess cook is not a specialty or rating.) Mess cooks help with meal preparation and with cleanup. It is equivalent to KP duty in the Army. However, on submarines this is not usually a punitive assignment. **Did they have special designations similar to the officers**? Yes, they did. Sailors who were qualified in submarines had an \"SS\" added to their ratings. For example, radioman a third class who has qualified in submarines would have his rating upgraded from RM3 to RM3(SS). This is a formal designation noted in the man's service record. Similar to the officer's designation, this did not limit their future assignments.",

This was particularly true of younger sailors reporting aboard their first boat. It was also true when reporting to a new assignment. Boats could be slightly different and the new command had to ensure that sailors new to the command knew what they said they did. Obviously, requalifying on a different boat would be fairly quick and easy. There may be training across similar ratings such as electronics or mechanicals. In addition, it was the responsibility of everyone on board to help train and to mentor the newest submariners.",

    "question": "What did a typical day at sea consist of?",
    "answer": "A typical day consisted of two four-hour shifts on watch plus time spent for maintenance, paperwork, studying and training. The time between 08:00 and 16:00 (8 AM to 4 PM) would usually be a work day, when maintenance, etc. would be completed. Twelve hours would not be unusual for a regular workday, and it could be even longer if the sailor was working toward his submarine qualification or studying for a promotion. Sundays were a day of rest. As long as there were no attacks in progress and no essential repairs, there would often be no routine work on those days. In other words, on your day off you \"only\" stood eight hours of watch. This assumes that there were three watch sections and the crew would be standing watches four hours on and then have eight hours off. If there weren't three qualified watchstanders for a specific position, then watches would be \"port and starboard\", meaning something like four hours on and just four off duty. That would last until a third watchstander could pass qualifications. The routine would also be adjusted a bit by dogging the watch about once per week. During the war, the routine would be changed by the need to carry out long attacks on enemy ships or by attacks on the boat by enemy ships and aircraft. Either of those could last many hours and would involve the whole crew. That would naturally require changes to the normal schedule and the boats would make whatever adjustments were needed for rest and food. There were a few instances of captains reversing the day so that the crew would be working at night when the engines were running (and noisy) and pulling fresh and, hopefully, cooler air into the boat. This would also mean that the boat could be submerged - quieter and calmer - while the crew is sleeping. This was usually done only when in the tropics. In these cases, the workday would be from 20:00 to 04:00 (8 PM to 4 AM) and meals would be offset by 12 hours. For example, breakfast would be around 20:00 rather than at 08:00. The crew would then sleep during daylight hours from 08:00 to 20:00.",

    "question": "What did a typical day in port consist of?",
    "answer": "The typical workday would be from 08:00 to 16:00. That could be started and ended earlier, called tropical hours, so that the crew isn't working during the hottest part of the day. However, in WW2 it was often longer than eight hours as men trained or got the boat ready for the next patrol. One third of the crew would remain on board overnight. This was so that there were enough men on board in case of emergencies and so the boat could get underway and change locations as needed. The duty section would likely have some work to do to continue repairs or to clean up after shipyard workers. This assumes that there are no major problems to be corrected. If, for example, engines needed to be overhauled, then the enginemen (motor macs in WW2) would work more hours. Others in the crew might be assigned to assist. The key thing is to get the boat ready for the next patrol. It is important to remember that sailors in the Pacific area did not go home at night.

    "question": "What clock times did the Navy use in WW2.",
    "answer": "The Navy used, and still uses, a 24-hour clock. That is often called military time or European continental time. Times between fifty-nine minutes past noon and midnight are expressed by adding 12 to the time that we are used to. Thus, 4 PM is 16:00; 8 PM is 20:00 and 11:59 PM is 23:59. Midnight is 00:00 and the hour until 01:00 is expressed as 00 plus the minutes. Noon is still 12:00. \"Zero Dark 30\" is still any time in the very early morning when sensible people are still asleep. This is true no matter where you are. For our ships, times were normally local. As the boats headed west, the clocks would be set back one hour as they crossed into the next time zone. Just as we civilians do now, we would set the clocks back three hours as we travel from the East Coast to the West Coast. > **NOTE**: The German and Japanese navies did not use local time. Their > clocks remained set to the time zones of their capitols. If there were a need to specify a time regardless of where the submarine might be, that would be stated as time zone Zulu. That is what most civilians might know as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). This would be used, for example, as the time for the cessation of hostilities, the end of the war.

    "question": "How does dogging the watch work?",
    "answer": "It means that one watch, usually the 12:00 to 16:00 is split into two shifts of two hours each. This has the effect of changing everyone's watch forward by four hours so no one stands the same watches all the time. This would be done about once per week. For example, the schedule for watch sections could be: ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 08:00 **12:00** **14:00** 16:00 20:00 00:00 04:00 -------- -------- ----------- ----------- -------- -------- -------- -------- Day 6 1 **2** **2** 3 1 2 3 Day 7 1 **2** **3** 1 2 3 1 Day 8 2 **3** **3** 1 2 3 1 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Watch section 2 in this example only stands half the 12:00 to 16:00 watch on day 7. Section 3 stands the last half of that watch, and will stand all of it on day 8. This gives section 2 a break from always standing mid-watches (00:00 to 04:00) and section 3 from always having the 04:00 to 08:00 watches. Everyone now stands watch four hours earlier than before we dogged the watch.",

    "question": "What were the general living conditions on a submarine like this?",
    "answer": "Living conditions were fairly poor, including the following, some of which are discussed further below: - A shortage of bunks - A lack of fresh air - Possible temperature extremes - Close quarters - Limited fresh water - A strong smell - Little dedicated food storage space - A lack of much personal storage - A lack of privacy **Since the crew size grew, but not the number of bunks, where did they all sleep?** There are enough bunks. There just aren't enough bunks for everyone to have a bunk to themselves. The numbers vary a little based on the actual number of men aboard for the patrol and the actual number of bunks available. However, assume there were about 70 bunks and 80 men. In that situation, 50 men would have their own bunks. The other 30 men would be assigned with three men to two bunks. They were assigned so that one of the three would be on watch at any time. That meant that if you were one of the 30 junior men and you had an opportunity to sleep - your work was done and your qualifications were current -- there was a bunk available. That was the good news. The less good news, for these 30 junior men, was that when they came off watch at midnight or 04:00 (AM) they would be getting into the same bunk that their relief had just gotten out of. It was called hot bunking for a reason. To further put that in context, we think the boats rarely were cooler than 90 degrees Fahrenheit if they were in the tropics as most of them were. There was the possibility of some good news. If the captain had an opportunity and fired torpedoes from the after torpedo tubes, bunking could improve. Reload torpedoes would be moved into the tubes, which were always kept full if possible. Now, for every torpedo fired, you could make two or three bunks on each empty skid. For every bunk that is created in this way, three sailors would no longer be hot bunking.",

    "question": "Is there a best place to sleep?",
    "answer": "Submarines are relatively noisy at night. Engines are running and batteries are being charged. The boat is on the surface plowing through waves. People are on watch, operating the submarine. All of that makes noise. Red lights help to make it easier to sleep, but the boat can't go completely dark. As a result, nothing will be as quiet and dark as your bedroom at home. Most areas seem to have advantages and drawbacks. The forward torpedo room is farthest from the engines, so that noise is at the lowest level here. However, you do hear the bow crashing through the waves. In addition, the bow, as well as the stern, experience the most vertical motion - up and down - due to the swells of the ocean. The after torpedo room has a little separation from the engines but does have the propellor shafts running under it with the screws not far behind. That does generate noise while on the surface. The after battery -- crews' berthing -- will probably have the least vertical motion. However, it is next to the forward engine room which will normally have at least one engine running at night. It also has a large fan pulling air out of the battery well during the battery charge. With 36 bunks in this space, the chances of at least one sailor snoring like a chain saw are close to 100%. > **NOTE**: The area on the port side of the crew's berthing, away from > the main passageway, is usually a bit better. There would normally be > a divider of some sort between the 18 port side bunks and the other > 18. That area on the port side, called Hogan's Alley, could then be a > little darker and a bit quieter. The top bunks are usually preferred since no one would step on your bunk as they climb up to theirs. Just watch out for all those little valves in the after corners of the crew's berthing area. You don't want to wake up with a start and imprint those valves on your forehead. The forward battery is likely to be one of the better places to sleep. There are still engine, fan and wave noises, as well as lights. But this space doesn't have the worst of any of the disadvantages. The key may be to become an officer or a chief petty officer so you can have a bunk in this compartment.",

    "question": "Is it ever truly quiet for sleeping?",
    "answer": "Finding a truly quiet place to sleep is very unlikely. There is constant activity on the boat. The engines are probably running at night and you can hear them, perhaps at a low noise level, anywhere on the boat. The battery is being charged. The electricians will go in and out of the battery wells to check on the specific gravity, to monitor progress of the charge. The boat is also on the surface which adds the noise of the boat cutting through the waves. If the swells are small, the rocking of the boat can help you get to sleep. If the swells are large, you may find yourself sleeping in odd positions so you can stay in your bunk. The key here is to get used to the noise and light quickly.

You may not get a very good night's sleep but it is possible to sleep this way. In big storms, captains would sometimes go deep for 12 hours or so. This would get the boat below most of the wave motion. Then the crew would have some time to eat a meal and get some sleep before going back up on the surface to fight the storm. In very heavy seas, you may have to strap yourself into your bunk in order to stay put.",

A depth of 100 feet makes a significant difference. Going to 150 or 200 feet would be below most wave action. Captains would go down to 300 or 400 feet in big storms and that would usually be calm enough. This would allow the crew to eat, digest their food and get some rest. Modern submarines need to be at 200 feet frequently to pick up any messages addressed to them. They have reported being bounced around quite a bit at 200 feet when they were in typhoons.

    "question": "What was the largest number of men on a US WW2 submarine?",
    "answer": "Again, the Gato/Balao/Tench boats generally had 80 to 85 men aboard. For the normal crew size, the largest number was likely the *Narwhal* and *Nautilus*, which were large, slow submarines built in the late '20s. (These boats were about 35 feet longer, 6 feet wider and almost twice the displacement of the Gato/Balao/Tench boats.) They usually had crews of about 90 men. That increased briefly to nearly 100 in the middle of the war and then returned to about 90. These submarines had two six-inch guns and were often used for minelaying and transport of small units of guerillas and regular troops. However, there were cases when boats had extra passengers as the result of special operations, rescues or lifeguard duty. A small sampling includes: - USS *Seawolf* (SS-1977) was lost in1944 with 82 crew and 17 US Army personnel aboard. - At one point, USS *Narwhal* (SS-167) picked up 32 evacuees, including eight women and two children. - Overall, submarines rescued 504 downed aviators during the war with USS *Tigrone* (SS-419)-rescuing 31 in a single patrol to break the record of 22 by USS *Tang* (SS-306). Some rescued airmen stood watches while on the boats. - USS *Gato* (SS-212), in 1943, evacuated 27 children, nine mothers and three nuns from Bougainville. - In September of 1944, USS *Pampanito* (SS-383) rescued 73 British and Australian soldiers in the South China Sea. The rescued soldiers were aboard for about five days. *Sealion* (SS-315) participated in the same rescue, picking up 52 soldiers. - When the USS *Darter* (SS-227) ran aground on a coral reef in late 1944, her crew was rescued by the USS *Dace* (SS-247). With two full crews aboard. there were likely about 160 sailors aboard the *Dace* for approximately one week. - In February, 1942, the USS *S-38* (SS-143) picked up 58 survivors from the British destroyer HMS *Electra*, sunk the day before at the Battle of the Java Sea.

    "answer": "Submarine sailors quickly learn to get past each other in the narrow passageways. However, there wasn't necessarily all that much movement going to battle stations, particularly during WW2. First, you often worked and slept near your battle station. For example, torpedomen usually stood watch, worked, slept and had their battle stations in the torpedo rooms. In addition, sailors typically had plenty of warning during the war that the captain was planning to attack. Smoke from potential targets could be spotted at least ten or fifteen miles away. Smoke would be seen well before the ships themselves. If the target would be cargo ships or tankers, which usually proceeded at 10 to 12 knots, the tracking party would be called away first. That could be an hour or more before going to battle stations. In addition, there are very few secrets on a submarine. There is barely enough room for a private thought, much less a secret. Word about a possible attack would spread through the crew quickly. Sailors would then have plenty of opportunity to drift toward their battle stations before the alarm would be sounded.",

These submarines did not have assigned damage control parties. The sailors who happen to be in the compartment where the problem occurs are the damage control party. That is why every submarine sailor has to learn damage control techniques. And that is why every submarine sailor needs to know the basics of every system on the boat.

    "question": "Where did they store all the oxygen for so many people?",
    "answer": "They didn't. These submarines did not have the capability to make or store large quantities of oxygen or to remove CO2. (Modern submarines do, and that's why they can be submerged for two or three months at a time.) In the WW2 boats, the air that they were breathing was the same air they had been breathing since they submerged. That air was intended to last 16 to 18 hours. Since most of the crew smoked, let's call it 16 hours. The normal procedure would be to surface every night to get fresh air in the boat. **How do you get fresh air into the boat? Where does the oxygen come from?** The best way to get breathable air in the boat is to run the engines to charge the battery. (To say it is *fresh* air may be a bit of a stretch.) The air system is set up so that most of the air for the engines goes straight to the engine rooms. However, some of it goes to the ends of the boat and gets pulled toward the engine rooms, refreshing the air in all the spaces. Running the low-pressure blower to push the last of the water out of the ballast tanks would use the air in the middle of the boat, also pulling fresh air in, this time through the conning tower hatch. The same thing would happen if the air compressors in the pump room were running to recharge the air banks. The routine was to be on the surface every night. This would hopefully top off the battery for the next day while freshening the air in the boat. Being on the surface each night also allowed the boats get their messages and, if the skies were cooperative, get a position fix using stars at dusk and again at dawn. If the boat had to remain submerged more than 16 hours - usually because it was being attacked - there were one-time measures that could be used. The first of those were the six green oxygen bottles and the many CO2 absorbent cans in the overheads. The silver-colored cans in the overhead, labeled \"DO NOT PAINT\", are the CO2 absorbent, typically lithium hydroxide. These will give you a couple more hours of breathable air. After that, the main option was to bleed air from the high-pressure air banks into the boat. This would pressurize the boat somewhat, but would improve the O2 and CO2 percentages. Even if the air in the boat were doubled, to two atmospheres, decompression would not be an issue. It would about the same as swimming and diving down to about 25 feet. To be clear, this air from the air banks isn't to be confused with fresh air, but it is air that allows the crew to survive.",

    "answer": "Most of them were, but that depended on where they were. If they were in the tropics, we suspect that the boats were rarely if ever below 90 degrees. And most of our boats were in the tropics for the majority of the time. The first issue is that the water temperature is 80 to 85 degrees. The next one is that the boat is constantly generating heat mainly from cooking, the engines and from charging or discharging the battery. In the tropics, the engine rooms would easily reach 100 degrees. When the engines were shut down when submerging, the cooling water to the engines would also shut down. Then the engine rooms could reach 120 degrees and the rest of the boat could be 110. It would take some time for the warm ocean waters to cool the boat back down. There is air conditioning, but it was really little more than a dehumidifier. Freidman, Page 200. It helped but didn't really cool the boat that much. If the boats were in northern or southern latitudes, the temperatures could be more moderate. This was particularly true in spring and fall. If the boats were operating off Alaska, they might actually be rather cold. The Japanese occupied the last two islands in the Aleutian chain at the time of the Battle of Midway. After that, we often had a submarine in the area monitoring any Japanese activity. In that area, the air and water temperatures may well be in the low 30s. If so, the boat would be cool or cold. The crew might be wishing for some of that excess tropical heat. It would also be cold in the boats during the winter if they were being tested during sea trials off Manitowoc, WI; Portsmouth, NH; or New London, CT.",

    "question": "Weren't the boats crowded?",
    "answer": "Submariners didn't usually think so. No one thought a submarine would be spacious when they volunteered. They knew it was small and would be all closed up when submerged. (The non-submarine admirals who complained that the new designs were too plush seemed to think otherwise.) Therefore, the boats did not seem that crowded to the crews. > **NOTE**: We sometimes point out that conditions on these submarines > do not meet the minimum standards for U. S. prisons. Most of that is > simply due to the lack of space per person and the fact that many of > the crew will not see daylight for weeks. Some may not even see the > sky at night. However, to be fair, conditions on most surface ships > aren't that much better. Still, it's really a matter of what you get used to and the crews quickly became accustomed to the conditions. It simply became the new normal. As Fletcher Pratt wrote about submariners in \"The Navy's War\", page 140: \"It was a club of individuals with an almost incredible ability to treat every circumstance as normal.\" \"Killer-Angel quote about normal Even though the crew could become accustomed to the close quarters, that didn't make it ideal. Of course, carrying a significant number of extra passengers, such as rescued personnel or special operations troops would make it more crowded. The crew might have to work a bit harder to make it seem normal.",

    "question": "There are showers on board. How often could the crew take showers?",
    "answer": "Rarely, if ever. On a submarine, there isn't enough fresh water for everyone to take showers regularly. This varied from boat to boat, but the stills only produced so much fresh water. They were also famously unreliable. If both stills were working at full capacity, they would produce about 5,000 gallons per week each. They were rarely both working at capacity and, in the patrol area, you would not use the stills when submerged. They use too much power and make too much noise. The first 500 gallons each week has to be distilled twice for the battery. The next claim for fresh water is the internal cooling systems for the engines. However, the engines don't normally require much water each week. The next claim would be by the cooks. Water is needed for coffee or bug juice (a sort of Kool-Aid), to cook your food and to wash the dishes. That leaves only a few gallons per day for the crew to brush their teeth, shave if they want to, and wash up a bit. We would like to have the cooks and the pharmacist mate (medic) shower about once a week. With so little water left after that, the rest of the crew would not normally take showers. They might only get a bucket of water periodically from the air conditioning condensate to wash out skivvies and then take a sponge bath. Since that water is extracted from the air in the boat, it will almost certainly have a thin sheen of oil on top. Any showers would be \"navy showers\". Fresh water is precious throughout the fleet, even where it is more plentiful than it was on submarines. A navy shower means that the sailor wets down and then turns the water off. He or she then soaps and lathers up. Then the water is turned back on to rinse off. Ideally, the total water usage is no more than three minutes. San Francisco residents tend to use water efficiently and that is still about 60 gallons per day. That would be over 5,000 gallons **per day** for 80 people plus the water needed for the battery. Submarines often didn't make that much water in a week.",

    "question": "If no one could take showers, didn't the submarine smell bad?",
    "answer": "Absolutely. Diesel submarines stank, especially when at sea. To clarify, it was true that most of the crew did not take showers. It would vary from boat to boat, but there just wasn't enough fresh water for everyone to take showers regularly. For obvious reasons, it was preferable that the cooks and the pharmacist mate (medic) be able to take showers, perhaps weekly. The rest of the crew may have gotten a bucket of water occasionally from the air conditioning condensate. They could use that to wash out skivvies and then take a sponge bath. Humans contributed significantly to the smell. But human bodies were not the only source of odors on submarines. There was the all-pervasive smell of diesel, other oils and engine exhaust gasses. Paint smells linger too. Paint might be the largest component of the odors on the *Pampanito* today. Most of the crew smoked since cigarettes were given away free to servicemen in WW2. (To be more accurate, most of the crew were active smokers and all the rest were second hand smokers.) Yes, you could smoke in these confined spaces even when submerged. Finally, three of the four heads (toilets) drained to sanitary tanks. The good news here is that these heads could usually be used when submerged. The less good news is that when you drain something into the sanitary tanks, you need to vent an equal amount of air. That would go through charcoal filters before venting back into the boat, but that only helped a little. Yes, diesel submarines smelled bad.",

    "question": "How could the sub sailors put up with the smell?",
    "answer": "There is some good news here. Diesel submarines are like gardenias, night-blooming jasmine, tuberose and hydrogen sulfide. (Hydrogen sulfide is a poisonous gas that smells like rotten eggs. However, submarines aren't usually poisonous.) What all these things, and many others, have in common with submarines is that after 15 to 30 minutes you stop smelling it. Olfactory nerves get saturated and stop sending signals to your brain. The nerves give up. You don't get used to the smell; you stop smelling it. You only notice the new smells, like fresh-baked bread and rolls at night. This is what makes hydrogen sulfide so dangerous. You no longer smell it but it can still kill you. The good news is that it is very rare to have hydrogen sulfide on an operating boat since it develops in closed spaces. We have very few of those and almost never go into them when at sea. Even if you are up on the bridge for a watch, the olfactory nerves don't normally reset. You are still mostly \"protected\" when you come down off the bridge.",

In addition, the overnight baker may have made pies or cakes. After the first week at sea, there would be little fresh fruit, vegetables or salads. Fresh food doesn't last that long, particularly with limited cold storage. Cheese and fresh eggs didn't last long either. Eggs would then be powdered after that.

Large cans of coffee, sugar and flour would be stored outboard of the engines. Eggs, butter and cheese would be stored in the forward escape trunk for as long as they lasted. As warm as it might be, it was likely the coolest place on the boat. Canned goods would be stored wherever there was room as long as they could be tied down securely and weren't in the way of operating equipment. One logical place would be the berthing spaces in the battery compartments. You would then be walking on your food -- the cases of canned goods covered by cardboard or wood -- until the crew ate the food down to the deck.

    "question": "What was the food like on a submarine?",
    "answer": "Since it has to be palatable to everyone aboard, it would tend to be basic. Perhaps it could be best described as basic American food -- meat, vegetables and potatoes or perhaps rice or pasta. Much of the food was canned although there was some freezer and refrigerated space aboard. Fresh vegetables and fruit didn't last long. Neither did fresh milk. Eggs and butter would be stored in the forward escape trunk and might last a bit longer. (The escape trunk might be the coolest place on a submarine but, if you are in the tropics, it wasn't really very cool.) Bread, rolls and perhaps pies or cakes were baked fresh each evening. Much of this is also true of surface ships. Food on submarines was not much more limited than it was on surface ships. To be fair, the crews might still grumble about the food. It has been said that a sailor isn't happy unless he (or she) is complaining about something. Sometimes the crew would drive the cooks crazy. On one patrol, the main request might be for strawberries. The cooks would then order more strawberries for the next patrol. Of course, the crew would now want more peaches on that next patrol and would complain about being stuck with all those stupid strawberries. There was one overnight baker on a submarine who asked his shipmates to write home for the recipe for his favorite cake. Get the recipe from his shipmates' wives, girlfriends or mothers. Then, on that sailor's birthday, he would bake that cake for dessert. This may not seem to be a big deal, but it mattered for morale. Scaling up the recipe may not have been as simple as it might seem since some ingredients, such as spices, can require different proportions.",

    "question": "Was the food really better than the rest of the Navy?",
    "answer": "Surprisingly, the food on submarines was the best food in the seagoing Navy. That goes back to the earliest days on subs. President Theodore Roosevelt visited one of our first submarines in 1901 or 1902. It was apparent that there needed to be some added incentives to get sailors to serve on those primitive boats. The answers were to increase the pay and to increase the food allowance. The food incentive was to increase the allowance per sailor on board. The Navy provides a certain amount per enlisted sailor for meals each day when assigned to a ship. The Navy provides a larger amount for those sailors assigned to submarines. Therefore, the Supply Officer and the cooks can order the special things from the standard stores list a little more often. Examples might be that they could order more frozen shrimp for shrimp cocktails or they could order better cuts of steaks more often. As a result of this incentive, the quality of the food on submarines became a fairly big deal. There are stories of captains fighting over good cooks, perhaps even physically. And you certainly didn't want to be a bad cook on a submarine. You may not last long on the boats.",

    "question": "Is that an ice cream machine in the crew's berthing?",
    "answer": "Yes, it is. Early in the war, there was no capacity to make ice cream on submarines. The boats may have been able to take small amounts with them on patrol, but there is little freezer space for up to 75 days at sea. Ice cream and oranges were the first things that sailors wanted when they returned from patrol. However, *Pampanito* has an ice cream machine. It is not clear when it was installed, but it doesn't seem likely that she had one when she was first built. The first machine wasn't installed on any submarine until the last half of '43 and probably didn't become standard equipment until '44. The first ice cream machine on a US submarine was stolen. It wasn't stolen from the submarine. It was stolen by the submarine. While the USS *Tang* (SS-306) was in Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Dick O'Kane, the captain, let it be known that he wanted an ice cream machine. It was not then standard equipment for submarines. His comment was probably code for \"make it happen and I probably don't want to know how you did it.\" The crew found an ice cream machine, on a pier, due to be installed in the wardroom of the battleship USS *Tennessee*. The crew \"acquired\" it and installed it in the pump room of the *Tang*. This story should sound too good to be true, a veritable \"sea story\". However, O'Kane made a reference to it in his book \"Clear the Bridge\" when he mentioned a forged receipt that was left for the *Tennessee*. After a war patrol, Admiral Lockwood, commander of submarines in the Central Pacific, came aboard for the usual patrol debrief. When he was served ice cream, he commented that the *Tang* had gotten the ice cream aboard quickly. O'Kane confessed that they had made the ice cream on board and showed Lockwood the machine. The admiral thought that was a good idea, and ice cream machines became standard equipment on submarines. What flavors were available? It seemed to be that you could have any flavor you wanted as long as it was white.",

It isn't too much of a stretch to say that there wasn't room for a private thought. However, everyone was in the same situation. If you expected to have what privacy was possible, you had to respect the privacy of others. Most often, that did work out pretty well. If you needed to be left alone for a bit, you normally would be. **If the war patrols were 45 to 60 days, how much time off did the crew get between them?** Generally speaking, the crew was in port for about four weeks after completing a full patrol. For the first two weeks, the crew had no responsibilities for the boat and were on liberty the whole time. A relief crew was responsible for the boat. (See below.) After that, the crew returned to duty for specialized training, finishing any work on repairs or upgrades on the boat, loading supplies and cleaning. Then they would spend about a week training as a crew. It was important to train as a full crew because there would be many new faces on board for the next patrol. Many of these newcomers were new to submarines and a few would be experienced hands returning to submarine duty. About 15 to 20% of the crew would be replaced at the end of each patrol. This was done to give some of the men a break after a series of war patrols. **Where would sailors be assigned when it was time for them to get a longer break?** The crewmen who were being rotated off the boat could be assigned to any number of duties. One of the most common would be to new construction. Submarines in the latter stages of being finished needed many experienced crewmen. The men coming off combat would help finish the new boat and provide the experienced core of the new crew. This way, they would also get a few months break from combat while the new boat is completed and then undergoes sea trials, post-construction repairs, training and then the transit to their new homeport. Other possibilities for assignments included training billets, division or squadron staff or relief crews. Relief crews were the experienced sailors who would take over for the first two weeks for boats coming off patrol. They started or assisted with repairs and upgrading equipment as needed. They were fully responsible for the boat so that the crew could get the full two weeks off. However, the commanding officer, executive officer and senior department heads would often monitor the work being done on the boat even during that two-week-off period. After about six war patrols, submarines were given an overhaul. Overhauls were extended maintenance periods for larger repairs and the installation training for new equipment. The hull might be cleaned for better speed. It could also be repainted. This would often be back on the West Coast so the added transit time is also part of the longer break between patrols.",

    "question": "How are things different before a sailor is qualified?",
    "answer": "When you report aboard your first submarine you are a non-qualified puke (NQP), a life form just below pond scum. Another version of this is that you are a useless food-consuming being (UFB). The main point is that you have a great deal of work to do before you are a qualified submariner. You are expected to spend your spare time working on your quals. During that time, you are not allowed to watch movies or play games. Your spare time, such as it may be, is supposed to be spent on your qualifications. **What did they do for entertainment once they completed qualifications?** The most common thing would be playing cards chess, or checkers. Acey deucey was a Navy version of backgammon. Cribbage was a frequent card game along with Bridge in the wardroom. There were also books and the radio. There were also movies, although not all were recent and they would often be shown multiple times. Playing cards had to be specially made or adjusted to be used under red lights. The hearts, diamonds and red numbers disappear in red light. (See below for information about the red lights.) When out in the Western Pacific, the radio would pick up Tokyo Rose, who was actually different persons at various times. The sailors would laugh at the propaganda -- it was interesting to find out you had been sunk multiple times -- but the music was surprisingly current.

    "answer": "As long as you are OK being in small space, it doesn't feel much different. You are inside the pressure hull, meaning that the pressure you feel personally isn't very different. It is sort of like being in a passenger plane. The change in pressure isn't very noticeable. The difference, of course, is that in airplanes, the outside pressure is less. In submarines, it is greater but it is still outside the pressure hull. In short, it was no big deal. Depending on the weather and the sea state topside, being submerged might be preferable The hull will compress a little when you go deep. However, at least on these WW2 boats, it isn't enough to notice a pressure change. It may still be enough to mess with the new crew members. You can tie a string from one side of the hull to the other and pull it tight when on or near the surface. Then, as you go deeper and the hull compresses, the string will sag all out of proportion to the actual compression. It looks far more significant than it is.",

Shortly after leaving port, the captain will usually do \"angles and dangles.\" This is normally announced in advance. The captain would then order depth changes with larger up and down angles.

    "question": "Why was there red lighting in some spaces?",
    "answer": "The primary purpose was to protect night vision. When going from white lights to darkness -- in this case up on the Bridge or looking through the periscope -- we are practically blind for 15 seconds or more. We were sending men up to the Bridge in darkness. We would prefer that they didn't hurt themselves getting there. When going from red lights to darkness, we usually avoid the time that we are completely blind. It also reduces the time to get full night vision. Although some people claim that it takes hours to get our full night vision, we can get most of it in about 20 minutes if we come from white lights. If, however, we come from red lights we get most of our night vision back in about 10 minutes. The lookouts in WW2 were looking for smoke on the horizon, usually the first indication of enemy ships. There may not have been a moon up yet, or maybe the sky was clouded over. They were looking for smoke in a dark, grey night. We needed to give the lookouts the best chance of seeing enemy activity that we could. When getting ready for a watch on the Bridge, sailors would usually be given red glasses or goggles to help preserve their night vision. This would prevent a stray flashlight or match from doing any damage to someone's night vision. However, all flashlights used in red-light spaces should have a red lens for the same reason. It also prevents white lights from giving away our location. White lights can show a beam for a great distance. If you remember the first 9/11 memorials in New York City, you know what this means. The memorials were just lights shining up to the sky from where the towers had stood. Those beams of light were visible for miles all around. Submarines don't want to show something like that.",

Finally, there were concerns about servicemen getting bad news when they couldn't do anything about it. There was no sense letting someone know about serious problems at home when he couldn't do anything at all about it. Letters were the obvious means of communications with families. Sailors might write regularly, but there was no incoming or outgoing mail when at sea. Large surface ships might get or send mail occasionally using replenishment ships. Since submarines operated separately or in small groups, there were no postal deliveries. As a result, sailors would receive mail from home and friends in batches. They would also mail their letters out in batches. Outgoing mail would be censored. It would normally be read by one of the officers and there might be some holes where sensitive information was cut out. Naturally, some sailors would develop code words or phrases that would provide some very basic information about what was happening. However, orders were secret before departure and the crew would not normally know where they would be patrolling next. There wasn't much they could give away. This is still mostly true today.

The fact is that there wasn't the room, and often not the time, for regular exercise. There was usually some work going on during the day in the few compartments with space. As a result, the only real exercise would come from whatever manual work you had to do or going up and down ladders.",

He did have his own desk as well as course and depth indicators. It should also be noted that he would probably be awakened often, in accordance with his night orders. He would want to know of any potential enemy contacts as soon as possible. He would also want to know when the battery charge was completed and when the boat was prepared for the activities of the next day. In peacetime, the captain would also want to know whenever any ship was expected to come within five miles of the boat. He would expect to know what the OOD was doing to stay clear of the other ship.",

    "question": "Did captains always get credit for ships they sank?",
    "answer": "They didn't always think so. The first issue is that captains often overestimated the type of ship that was attacked, the damage done and the tonnage sunk. This estimate would be more accurate if the target was positively identified and then sunk. It helped if some of the wreckage with the ship's identification could be recovered. Then there were reviews of the claims by the individual captains by the submarine commanders for the area -- the Central Pacific and the Southwest Pacific. Monitoring Japanese radio traffic could often confirm sinkings and the identities of those ships. That could increase the captains' claims but most often reduced them The final review, after the war, was by the Joint Army--Navy Assessment Committee (JANAC) which audited Japanese naval losses in WW2. This almost always resulted in captains losing credit for some ships sunk. Japanese records may not have been complete, particularly with regard to smaller vessels, those under 500 tons. Many submarine captains believed that they did not get full credit for the ships they sank.",

    "question": "In what battles were submarines involved?",
    "answer": "This question usually is asking about the major naval battles of WW2 such as Coral Sea, Midway, The Philippine Sea and Leyte Gulf. Submarines were involved in most of the major battles of the war, but usually indirectly or at the edges. It makes sense that submarines did not want to be in the middle of a major gun battle. That would be too much like being dog in the middle of a bison stampede. It would be too easy to be run over while no one noticed. Submarines did provide important intelligence. The most important information would be the location, composition and heading (sailing direction) of enemy forces. They sometimes had the opportunity to attack those forces before or after the big battles and, at times, were very successful. In other cases, our submarines contributed by destroying supplies, destroying troop ships or providing lifeguard duty for our aviators. They did contribute even without being in the middle of the battle. The history of submarines participating around the great naval battles of WW2 will be described further below. However, submarines were in many smaller battles. Nearly every time a submarine attacked Japanese ships, they found themselves in a battle. The Japanese did not take kindly to having their ships attacked and they fought back. The intensity and duration of the battles varied. Sometimes the Japanese had trouble finding our submarines and they would just drop depth charges to try to deter another attack. Sometimes there was a limited number of escorts and it was more important to guard the remaining ships than to find and sink the submarine. At other times the attacks were ferocious and prolonged.",

    "question": "*[USS Puffer]{.underline}*",
    "answer": "The *USS Puffer*, on her first patrol in late 1943, was held down longer than any other boat during the war. It began with an attack on a tanker. The captain hit the tanker with two torpedoes, but it wouldn't sink. While the captain maneuvered for another shot, the enemy escort, identified by the captain as a *Chidori*-type destroyer but more likely actually a sub chaser, attacked and did some minor damage in multiple areas. However, some gaskets may have been damaged, allowing water to leak into the main induction piping and the boat. The captain then went to 400 feet and expected to wait out the escort. But it didn't happen that way. The sub-chaser captain was determined and skilled and he had excellent sonar operators. Each time the *Puffer* maneuvered, the sub-chaser picked her up. About every hour the sub-chaser dropped a few more depth charges. The crew of the *Puffer* later suspected that they were leaving a trail of bubbles or oil. That may well have been true since they later found the main induction piping flooded, which added about 12 tons of extra weight to the boat. Naturally, that made depth control that much harder. *Puffer* went down to 500 feet. The captain had ordered the air conditioning secured to save the battery and the temperature in the boat reached 125 degrees. The hours dragged on. The men faded from stress and heat. The conditions on the boat continued to get worse. The heat sucked the energy out of the men. It dehydrated them and made them nauseous. Some crew members would drink water only to vomit it back up again. The decreasing level of oxygen in the air left the men with hypoxia, making them more likely to be confused, angry and anxious. It certainly left them fatigued. The prolonged exposure to adrenalin left the men euphoric at first and then with negative attitudes. Those who had something to do fared better. By now, the sub-chaser had run out of depth charges with his (approximately) hourly attacks. However, the Japanese skipper still tracked the *Puffer* hoping to force it to the surface. The crew of the *Puffer* was very aware of the enemy above them and the skill of their hunters. The enemy's propellor noises were easily heard through the hull. Eventually, a second and perhaps a third sub-chaser joined in. Depth charges were again being dropped. After 18 to 20 hours, the discipline on the boat began to break down. The official submarine historian reported that \"The hurriers and worriers had all crapped out, leaving the plodders to bring home the ship.\" The historian further relates: > Both officers and men were \"mad at everything and anything. They were > particularly mad at themselves for allowing themselves to be caught in > such a situation. They cursed themselves for being such fools as to > serve in submarines. They cursed the enemy for their persistence. They > spent much time daydreaming about what they would do to the sub-chaser > above them -- discussing such fantastic schemes and ideas as > discharging acid around the ship \\[above\\] to eat holes in the hull.\" The captain of the *Puffer* had been broadcasting a \"play-by-play\" over the PA system (the 1 MC.) That just angered some of the crew who believed it just made too much noise. Eventually, the play-by-play information was passed over sound-powered phones, which could be much quieter. That later became standard procedure. By now, many of the men had sunk into a stupor and watch stations were manned by volunteers. Many of the others were past caring. The captain did an informal poll of the boat as to whether the crew would prefer to surface and fight it out. In spite of their situation, most men said no, preferring to wait it out. *Puffer* remained at 500 feet all that night and the next day as conditions worsened. After dark on the second day, the captain felt he had no choice -- surface or suffocate. The last of the emergency oxygen had been released into the boat. The CO2 absorbent had all been used and the battery was nearly completely discharged. He took the boat up to 250 feet and then blew ballast and went directly to the surface, without stopping at periscope depth for the normal look around. One sub-chaser appeared on radar but *Puffer* was able to escape by presenting a small profile and using a darkened land mass for cover. *Puffer* had been submerged for almost 38 hours. The boat returned to Fremantle, submerging by day to continue making repairs. It turns out that *Puffer* was pushed about 12 miles to the northeast by currents during her ordeal. It appeared that the sub-chasers had remained closer to the area of the initial attack. As the investigation proceeded, it was suggested that the captain, officers and crew should all be reassigned to other boats. The thinking was that it would be very difficult for any new crew members to be accepted by those who underwent the ordeal. \"Puffer's ordeal welded her men together in a fraternal, almost mystic bond, and no newcomer was able to penetrate the inner circle.\" The initial story was that about 50% of the crew were reassigned, but it turned out be less than that. The captain was reassigned along with one other officer and about 30% of the crew. The new captain had to do a lot of training as a result. He wrote: \"And it was not only 'training' but 'retraining' since I felt it necessary to change attack procedures and various other things for psychological reasons.\" *Puffer* went on to make eight more war patrols. Wartime credit was for sinking 14 ships plus one shared for a total of 102,800 tons. JANAC reduced that to 8 ships plus one shared credit for 38,707 tons. Other ships were damaged. Smaller vessels, such as barges, luggers and sea trucks, likely were sunk but were too small to be credited. Her captain during that first war patrol was reassigned as assistant for submarine operations on the staff of Commander Submarines, 7^th^ Fleet. There, he earned a commendation for being largely responsible for the successful interception of two enemy task forces. There was no indication whether any of the crew asked to leave submarine service. Sources: \"Silent Victory\" by Clay Blair Jr., pages 499 to 501 > \"The USS Puffer in World War II\" by Craig R.

    "question": "*[USS Salmon]{.underline}*",
    "answer": "The *Salmon,* the lead boat in a class of six, was built by Electric Boat Company. She was commissioned in March of 1938. As one of the \"fleet boats\" built between the wars, she was slightly shorter than the boats built during the war, such as the *Pampanito.* Another important difference is that she was a 250-foot boat; she was only tested to a depth of 250 feet. In October of 1944, while on her 11^th^ war patrol, Salmon was part of a wolfpack led by the captain of the *Silversides*. *Trigger*, also in that wolfpack had found a large tanker with four escorts and attacked. One torpedo broached and was spotted. The tanker turned away and the torpedoes missed. The next salvo by *Trigger* blew the stern off the tanker. The tanker was dead in the water but still afloat and *Trigger* had to go deep. Upon surfacing, she notified the rest of the pack about the tanker. *Salmon* was the next boat to attack that night. The tanker was not moving but was still guarded by four alert escorts. *Salmon* fired four torpedoes with two hitting the target. *Salmon* went to 300 feet. The escorts administered a \"severe depth-charging.\" That included four patterns nearby, with a total of about 30 depth charges. *Salmon* was badly damaged, with a score of leaks, and driven down to about 500 feet -- below the scale of the depth gauges. - The main induction piping was flattened and flooded. This added almost seven tons to the weight of the boat even though the piping had flattened. - The steering gear was out of commission. - The engine exhausts were jammed. - Stern planes were jammed in the dive position. - The After Torpedo Room hatch was blown open, but the boat was saved by the fact that a bottom plate had been bolted to the hatch trunk. Other hatch trunks flooded as well. - The vent for Fuel Ballast Tank #7 ruptured and 7,000 gallons of diesel fuel were replaced by heavier sea water. - There were serious leaks in the Conning Tower. - Water levels began to approach the main motors. - Numerous other pressure gauges, meters and instruments were damaged by shock. - The main gyrocompass panel short-circuited. - The flooding from pressure fittings had not been controlled and exceeded the ability to pump water out. - Salmon had difficulty maintaining depth and at one point went to a reported 578 feet. The captain decided that his only hope was to surface and fight it out, which is usually futile. When he surfaced the boat, he found that the nearest escort was 7,000 yards (3.5 nautical miles) away. For some reason, the escort did not attack right away, perhaps not seeing her. That gave *Salmon* more time to patch some leaks, correct a 15-degree list and open the engine exhausts. The engines came to life. Finally, the escort charged, probably to ram *Salmon*. However, *Salmon* also charged, thinking that offense was the best defense. The boat passed the escort within 50 yards while firing every gun available. That included \"two coke bottles which an excited seaman hove at her\". The charge apparently killed everyone topside on the escort, which stopped dead in the water, on fire. *Salmon* fended off a charge from a second escort. She then hid in a rain squall and radioed for help. Six other boats responded. The boats sent spurious radio messages to make it sound like more ships were coming. *Salmon* was then able to make enough repairs to submerge again to await the arrival of assistance. While some of the boats were gathering, *Sterlet* took the time to finally sink the tanker, for which *Trigger, Salmon* and *Sterlet* all shared the credit, one-third each. *Sterlet* escorted *Salmon* back to Saipan. When the engineers inspected the boat, they decided that the damage was so extensive that it wasn't practical to repair the boat for combat. *Salmon* was sent to Portsmouth to be patched up. She could then serve as a training boat, although one source indicated that *Salmon* was just scrapped. The entire crew was transferred to the *Stickleback*, which was being built in Mare Island.

    "question": "*[USS Sculpin]{.underline}*",
    "answer": "*Sculpin* was a Sargo class \"fleet boat\" completed at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in 1939, along with her sister ship the *Squalus.* Both boats had been operating off the New Hampshire coast in 1939 when the *Squalus* sank. The main induction valve on *Squalus* had been left open or came open. When the *Squalus* was noted as overdue, the search for her began. *Sculpin* was the vessel that located the *Squalus* and the rescue effort began. *Sculpin* was able to communicate with *Squalus* to help keep spirits up. The submarine rescue ship *Falcon* was rushed to the scene. Using a diving bell, all the survivors of the initial flooding were rescued. *Squalus* was raised in 1940 and cleaned up. She was recommissioned as the *Sailfish* and served through the war. However, the new name didn't fool any of the sailors. They knew her as the \"Squalusfish.\" In a series of events tinged with irony, *Sculpin* was lost with the majority of her crew in November of 1943. She had found a convoy and prepared to attack. However, *Sculpin's* periscope was spotted and the convoy turned to ram the boat. *Sculpin* went deep to avoid the attack. After the convoy had passed, the captain returned to the surface, intending to do an \"end around\" and attempt an attack. However, he was surprised to find the Japanese destroyer *Yamagumo* waiting for them. *Sculpin* dove again quickly and the destroyer attacked. *Sculpin* was damaged, went deep again and remained there for several hours. As the boat was coming toward the surface again, the depth gauge stuck at 125 feet. Not realizing what was happening, the diving officer kept pumping water overboard. As a result, the boat broached the surface. The *Yamagumo* was still waiting for *Sculpin* and attacked. Sculpin headed back down. This time, the damage from 18 depth charges was severe. The leaks were serious and the bow and stern planes and the steering gear were out of commission. The captain decided that surfacing to fight it out with the deck gun was his only choice. As was usually the case in such a gun dual, the submarine did not fare well. One of the first rounds from the destroyer hit *Sculpin's* bridge, killing the captain, the executive officer and the gunnery officer. The next senior officer remaining decided to scuttle the boat and passed the word to \"abandon ship.\" The crew donned life jackets and the chief of the watch started to open the vents. The division commander, Captain John Cromwell, was aboard *Sculpin* for the possibility of arranging a wolfpack. Captain Cromwell was concerned about the information he knew about future operations and about Ultra, the fact that we were able to break Japanese codes. He feared that he might not be able to keep these secrets when tortured and decided he would go down with the *Sculpin.* The young diving officer, probably feeling responsible for the disaster, decided he too would stay with the boat along with 10 others. Captain Cromwell was recommended for the Medal of Honor after the war. It was awarded to his widow. The Japanese rescued three officers and 39 men. However, one man was injured and the Japanese simply threw him over the side. After interrogation at Truk, the survivors were divided into two groups and put aboard the Japanese escort carriers *Chuyo* and *Unyo.* Those carriers sailed with the large carrier *Zuiho.* Both *Skate* and *Gunnel* attempted attacks on *Zuiho* but were thwarted. In a great storm, *Sailfish* found the carriers. The Japanese commander had rescinded the submarine warning and stopped zigzagging due to the storm and high seas. In three separate attacks, *Sailfish* sank the *Chuyo*. All but one of that group of 21 *Sculpin* survivors were lost with the *Chuyo.* However, at this point, no one from the *Sculpin* had been present when she had located the *Squalus* back in 1939.

    "question": "[*USS Halibut* (SS-232)]{.underline}",
    "answer": "*Halibut* was a Gato class boat completed in 1942. In November of 1944, she was on her 10th war patrol operating as part of a wolfpack in the area of the Formosa (now Taiwan) Strait. *Halibut* had found a small convoy with three escorts. The captain fired four torpedoes at the largest ship from 3,100 yards. This was much farther away than usual, but as close as they could get. *Halibut* thought they had two hits but could not confirm them. Shortly after that Skeeter, the mascot (a dog) on board, started to growl and the sonar operator also picked up a strange noise. It was later believed to be a low-flying airplane with a magnetic anomaly detector. This aircraft dropped a depth bomb that rocked the *Halibut.* It is also likely that the aircraft also dropped a marker of some sort. Shortly after the aircraft attack, two escorts took turns working together to drop series of depth charges in \"a short, very severe depth-charging.\" The explosions happened in such rapid succession that the total count was lost. The damage to *Halibut* was severe and nearly fatal. It included: - The Conning Tower was dished in by one sequence of depth-charges that also pushed the boat deep. - Various tanks and the deck were \"rippled.\" - Other charges pushed the *Halibut* deep, beyond her test depth. - The skids in the forward room jumped up about a foot, damaging the torpedoes. - The deck plates in the forward room also jumped, shearing the bolts holding them in place. The men in the space were dumped into the bilges. - Sea valves spun open and the escape trunk leaked. - \"Meanwhile the line to the #1 air bank in the forward battery well carried away. The rush of high-pressure air, and the combined odors of hair tonic, shaving lotion, glypton \\[sic\\] and food caused the personnel in the compartment to believe it was flooding and chlorine gas was escaping; hence they abandoned and secured the compartment. #1 bank bled down, creating a 50# pressure in the compartment. This prevented opening the after door or the flappers.\" (From the captain's report.) After carefully determining that there was no chlorine gas, the overpressure had to be vented into the Forward Torpedo and Control Rooms, a loud and slow process. Even Skeeter, the mascot, couldn't tell if the Japanese were still searching from above. - Motors for the sound heads (sonar) failed, requiring they be turned manually. - The breech of the 4-inch deck gun was pierced by shrapnel. The gun was wrecked. - The main induction valves, meant to bring in air on the surface, had been damaged and were letting in seawater. - The gyrocompasses no longer worked. - The radio was out of commission. *Halibut* could only communicate with other boats using the SJ radar and Morse Code. - The Control Room clock was frozen at 13:46:24. - One of the periscopes \"had all its insides torn loose.\" - Compartments were littered with hydraulic fluid, cork insulation and glass. - The were endless leaks from pipes and valves. The Japanese then left the *Halibut*. \"For some reason the Jap\\[anese\\] shoved off. A little persistence would have paid off. The beating the ship took and survived brings our admiration and respect to the men who designed her, the people who built the *Halibut* and those who recently overhauled her at Bethlehem Steel Company.\" (Captain's report.) \"First aid\" repairs were completed at Saipan and Pearl Harbor. *Halibut* was then sent to the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard for final assessment. The detailed list of damage covered three typewritten pages. It was determined that the damage was too extensive to justify the needed repairs. *Halibut* was \"relieved from active service.\" Plans to convert *Halibut* to a school (training) boat were cancelled and she was sold for scrap. After the war, Skeeter was adopted by one of the ship's cooks.

    "question": "*[Pampanito]{.underline}*",
    "answer": "Pampanito started her first war patrol on March 15, 1944, one year to the day after her construction was started. *Pampanito's* assignment was as part of a group of ten submarines providing lifeguard duty for our aircraft. The planes were attacking Japanese bases at Yap and the Palau islands in the Carolines. *Pampanito's* services as a lifeguard were not required. She was then reassigned to an area south of Guam. While in that area, *Pampanito* attacked a convoy and believed she had two hits on a large ship. The Japanese escorts counter-attacked. Among the resulting damage, the most significant was probably a crack in the main induction piping. That resulted in a loud squealing noise that was disturbing in itself. It also meant that the Japanese could hear *Pampanito* on their sonar. When the main induction piping finally filled, the boat went quiet. However, she also went deep since the piping held about 15 tons of water. *Pampanito* went down below 600 feet (the designed depth for the boat) and could not pump water out of the boat since it would make too much noise. They couldn't speed up, for easier depth maintenance, because that too would make excess noise. They kept a large up angle on the boat in order to maintain depth at low speed. This worked. Eventually, *Pampanito* was able to get away and drain the piping. There was still the need to fix the piping so they could submerge safely in the future. If they couldn't fix it, they would have to end the patrol. Crew members looked over the piping to find the leak. (The piping is below the deck but above the pressure hull.) However, they couldn't find the problem. The best solution they could think of was to give a wrench and a flashlight to the smallest sailor on the boat. They then put that man into the pipe, closed it up behind him, and submerged. His job then was to crawl through the pipe until he found the leak and bang on the pipe with his wrench. Once it was located, the crew was able to repair the pipe well enough to remain on patrol. For more information, review the details of *Pampanito's* first war patrol in the War Patrol Summary section. Sources: \"USS Pampanito, Killer-Angel\" by Gregory Michno, Chapter 3.",

    "question": "How did submarines find targets?",
    "answer": "Submarines had various ways to find targets during WW2. One was just to search in the area they were given to patrol. It would be up to the captain to try to determine the most likely areas for successful hunting. That would be based on their own experience, information from other captains in patrol reports and general intelligence information. If enemy shipping had gotten past another American submarine, that boat would broadcast the location and best estimate of base course and speed. That would hopefully allow other boats to get into position to attack. We began to formally use wolfpacks in the fall of 1943**.** Now submarines were working together to identify the most likely routes for enemy shipping and to plan coordinated attacks. Once ships were sighted, then the wolfpack executed their attack plans while not endangering each other. The captains also applied their own analysis to all the information they had and make their best estimate of what the enemy could do and might do. For example, if a captain had been successful in a particular area, he might estimate that for the next few days, at least, enemy shipping might be routed away from him. Where they might go could be limited by geography, likely shelters or ports, etc. Or, perhaps as the *Batfish* found, there could be more Japanese ships passing along the same route and they should quietly stay in that area. In the case of the *Batfish*, the targets were submarines. *Batfish* simply remained where they had just sunk one Japanese boat and claimed two more over the next 72 hours. > **Note:** Two books that provide insight into the thinking of our > captains are \"Thunder Below\" by Gene Fluckey and \"Clear the Bridge\" by > Richard (Dick) O'Kane. One of the books on the *Batfish* is \"In the > Course of Duty -- The Heroic Mission of the USS Batfish\" by Don Keith. There were also the \"Ultra\" or \"Magic\" messages. These contained information provided to the captains based on our intercepts of Japanese messages. We had broken most of the Japanese naval codes. If we could decipher the message in time, we could provide the information to captains helping them to intercept and attack the targets. Then there was just plain luck. An enemy vessel might just happen to be transiting through your assigned area. In that case, you had to be looking for clues that targets might be nearby. Radar might have picked up unidentified contacts. (The use of radar was often limited to avoid giving away one's own location.) Other methods were sighting smoke on the horizon and hearing propellor sounds through sonar. It might even be possible to notice an aircraft in the distance flying circle patterns that could be protective cover for a convoy.",

You might also miss shipping that was proceeding through your assigned area that the higher commanders assumed you would intercept. This was likely frustrating for some captains. The most successful captains were often assigned to the most promising areas. That might mean that the less successful captains might have a difficult time finding the targets to become successful, and to then get the better assignments.",

    "question": "What did they do if they found a possible target?",
    "answer": "The first thing the Officer of the Deck (OOD) would do would be to order a course to point the submarine at the target. Then the OOD would immediately alert the captain. Once the boat was pointed at the target, the captain could determine which way it was moving relative to the boat. He could then decide what course to take to get in front of the target to be able to attack. At some point, if there was a chance of getting close enough for an attack, the captain would call for the tracking party. It would help provide confirmation of the captain's estimates and allows him to make needed adjustments. Eventually, if it appears that the submarine can get within firing range of the target, the captain will call the full crew to battle stations and attack.",

    "question": "How did they know they were enemy ships?",
    "answer": "The first indication would be a lack of information about any friendly ships in the area. In WW2, submarines were operating deep into enemy areas and could start with the assumption that any ship was likely to be hostile. If there were friendly ships in the area, did the potential targets match any of that information? Then it was a matter of identification. The US had books that described the known Japanese warships, merchant ships and tankers. Captains would use features such as the type of bow and stern, the types of masts and funnels to compare what was seen in the periscopes to what could be found in the book. Captains would be very familiar with the outlines of the Japanese warships, and that made identification faster and easier. One could also be more confident that it was an enemy ship if it was shooting at you. However, by the end of the war, we had sunk most of the Japanese merchant fleet. It then became easier to find another American submarine than it was a Japanese ship to attack. (The joke was that you could cross the South China Sea just stepping from one American periscope to another.) Obviously, more caution was needed then.",

    "question": "Did anyone ever make a mistake in ship identification?",
    "answer": "Definitely, although most of those were mistakes in confusing one Japanese ship for another. Captains might identify a cruiser as a battleship or a destroyer as a cruiser. They might overestimate the size of the cargo ship or tanker that they attacked. In other cases, our submarines were attacked by friendly aircraft or ships, particularly early in the war. As a result, submarines quickly learned to never trust any airplanes except, perhaps, those planes that would escort the boat into port. It isn't completely clear, but we may have lost one or two submarines to our own aircraft. In one of the saddest incidents in the war, an American submarine sank a Russian hospital ship. It was misidentified in the fog as an enemy combatant, and the captain had not seen the notice that the hospital ship would be transiting the area. It was a diplomatic disaster. The captain lost his command.",

It would include the personnel to log events, plot the target's movements relative to the boat, and to man the Torpedo Data Computer or TDC. This is the device that calculates the final course for any torpedoes. However, at this early stage, the TDC is important because it provides a running estimate of the target's location and movement.

    "answer": "This would depend on what type of ship the target is. Generally, the larger the ship, the more torpedoes that would be used. The more armored the ship, the more torpedoes that would be needed. If the target is pointed right at you, such as a destroyer or other escort, you would likely only fire one at a time if you dared the shot at all. Carriers and battleships would rate all six torpedoes if firing from the Forward Torpedo Room or all four from the After Torpedo Room. Destroyers might rate two or three. Cruisers and large cargo ships and tankers might rate three or four. Smaller cargo ships might rate only two.",

    "question": "How many torpedo hits would it take to sink a ship?",
    "answer": "That also depends on a variety of factors. What type of ship is it? Is it in good condition? What is it carrying? Is it fully loaded or nearly empty? What part of the target did you hit? Here are some examples: - US submarines sank only one Japanese battleship. The *Sealion* sank the battleship *Kongo* in November of 1944. That required three hits from a salvo of six fired. - Carriers normally required multiple hits because of their size. However, *Albacore* managed to sink the Japanese carrier *Taiho* with a single torpedo. *Albacore* had help from a fatal mistake by Japanese damage control. More details are below in the Battle of the Philippine Sea. - Sam Dealey, captain of the *Harder*, was the destroyer killer. He was sometimes using \"down the throat\" shots which meant the destroyer was coming directly at him to attack. Dealey would fire torpedoes and the destroyer would try to turn away. That actually presented a wider target. Typically, only one torpedo would hit the destroyer. It was a very dangerous method unless it worked. Few other captains used this method. - Hitting an ammunition ship could easily result in a huge explosion and a quick sinking. - Tankers could explode with one torpedo hit if it carried gasoline. In that case, the explosion could be a blinding flash and the ship would just be gone when the smoke cleared. However, if it were carrying crude oil, it might not sink unless a fire was started. (Crude doesn't start burning easily.) - An empty tanker could be very difficult to sink unless it was hit in the engineering spaces. Since the tanks were designed to be full of fuel or ballast water, a torpedo might only fill them with seawater. Such damage would need to be repaired, but might have only slowed the ship a little. - The *Salmon* actually sank a ship with a torpedo that didn't explode. It was an old ship and the dud torpedo punched right through its side. That was enough to flood and sink the target. - The *Rakuyo Maru*, the ship from which the Pampanito rescued the 73 British and Australian soldiers, who were POWs, was carrying raw rubber. Although rubber is too dense to float, the fact that it filled that hold and absorbed most of the explosion, left the *Rakuyo Maru* sinking very slowly. It allowed the soldiers time to climb back aboard and to find a little food, water and materials for rafts.",

    "question": "What usually happened after we attacked Japanese ships?",
    "answer": "For some reason, that seemed to make the Japanese angry and they would respond. Sometimes we were fortunate and, in the chaos that followed, the Japanese would drop depth charges indiscriminately. They might not be anywhere near the attacking boat. In those cases, they seemed to be hoping mostly just discourage another attack or to scare the submarines away. Other times, the counter attacks were very effective. Remember that we did lose 52 submarines during the war and at least 27 were due to Japanese anti-submarine warfare forces.",

    "question": "How were our submarines detected?",
    "answer": "If our captains were lucky or very good, the first indication of one of our submarines would be a torpedo exploding against the side of a Japanese ship. Note, however, that our captains would often be firing from inside the Japanese escorts. In addition, the steam torpedoes that we used during WW2 left a trail of bubbles and smoke that pointed back to where the submarine fired them. It wasn't always difficult to figure out where the submarine had been. The Japanese did have electronics such as radar and sonar. However, they did not seem to place as much importance on them as we did. Some ships did not have radar until late in the war. It also appears that we and the British were making far more upgrades to our equipment. Still, the Japanese electronics were good enough that they were sometimes able to detect our submarines. They could also detect our radio and radar transmissions. That is a large part of the reason why American submarines used radar sparingly and transmitted few messages. Japanese aircraft would patrol the routes that their ships used most often. Another good place to look for submarines is around their convoys. Sometimes they were able to catch our boats on the surface. That would still be useful information even if the plane was not able to attack.",

    "question": "How did submarines escape?",
    "answer": "If the submarine was submerged, the most important thing would be to be very quiet so that the Japanese sonar didn't pick us up. Most often, that also meant moving very slowly. Once an attack run was started by a Japanese ASW ship, they would approach at high speed. They too have to get clear of the explosion. When they are running at high speed their sonar would be overwhelmed by their own ship noises and the flow of water over their equipment. That allows the submarine captain a brief opportunity for evasion tactics such as turning or changing depth or speed. However, if there are multiple ships attacking the submarine, the others can move slowly enough for their sonars to still be effective. Generally, it was a cat and mouse game. It would be the wits and ingenuity of the submarine captain against his attacker(s). The submarine also had the advantage of using all three dimensions. The attackers had to estimate not just where the submarine was but also how deep it was. Depth charges had to get pretty close - probably within 25 feet or so - to the submarine to breach the hull and sink it. Our submarines were rather sturdy and could absorb a fair amount of damage. Sometimes the key was to contain and repair the damage long enough so that the Japanese would just assume that they must have been successful. Outlast them %%%% There is also an ejection tube in the After Torpedo Room. That tube can be used to launch a countermeasure. The most primitive version is a compound that generates bubbles when it is ejected into water. (It behaves very much like a giant Alka Seltzer.) This provides two targets for the Japanese sonar since any change in density will reflect sonar, either the steel hull or the empty bubbles. This only a temporary decoy since the bubbles will disburse and rise to the surface. %%%% Was this available to US boats in WW2. It was to the Germans. Captains would also be looking for a \"layer.\" That is a sudden change in temperature as the boat goes deeper. The change in temperature can distort sonar, bending it to confuse the pulse, or even reflect it allowing the submarine to hide. Such a layer is called a thermocline. There is a bathythermograph in the Control Room. It is a small box that records the water temperature at various depths. If the submarine is on the surface, other factors come into play. Of course, one choice is to submerge quickly and then turn or go deep before the attacker comes close. Assuming that it is in the hours of darkness, there are things that can help make the submarine less visible to an attacker. Point away for lowest profile. Experimented with colors to be least visible. Might be able to outrun the attacker if it is small enough. Fog or rain squalls Hope no bioluminescence Up moon or down?",

    "question": "Midway:",
    "answer": "We had arranged a semi-circle of submarines to look for the Japanese fleet. Our code breakers had figured out that they were going to attack Midway, but we didn't know exactly where they were coming from. The Japanese were very good at radio silence as they had demonstrated prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor. The *Nautilus* found the attacking ships (or more accurately they found her.) *Nautilus* wasn't able to attack but contributed indirectly. The Japanese had left a destroyer behind to keep the *Nautilus* down until the fleet was safely past. Our carrier aircraft were already in the air but were having difficulty finding the Japanese carriers. Fortunately, some of our planes spotted the destroyer and correctly guessed that it was racing to catch up with the main body. They turned in that direction and found the carriers. Luck was on our side since the Japanese planes were preoccupied with our torpedo bombers and because their admiral had his planes on deck being rearmed and refueled. Many bomb hits on the Japanese carriers resulted in huge fires and secondary explosions. The result was a devastating victory for the US. After the main battle, *Nautilus* found a battleship with escorts and fired two torpedoes. One misfired and the other missed. Later, *Nautilus* found one the Japanese carriers aflame. She fired four torpedoes at the carrier *Kaga* and heard explosions. Nautilus thought they had sunk the carrier but one torpedo had misfired, two missed and the fourth hit the target but didn't explode. > This could have been another indication of problems with our > torpedoes, specifically the Mark XIV (14). One submarine, the *Grayling*, was attacked by US B-17 bombers who thought they had sunk a Japanese cruiser in fifteen seconds. The *Grayling* had exchanged recognition signals with the aircraft. When the planes continued their attack, *Grayling* immediately crash-dived and escaped. This was after the main engagement. > NOTE: American submariners learned to never trust **any** airplane -- > ours or the Japanese. The standard procedure was always to dive when > aircraft approached unless the plane was escorting the boat into port. > During the war, one American submarine was sunk by an American pilot > %%%%% while in a \"safe lane\" where the pilot was not supposed to > attack any vessel, whether ours or Japanese. In the early morning dark of the next day, *Tambor* found a group of Japanese ships near Midway. She sent a contact report, thinking they had located the Japanese invasion force. However, the cruisers she spotted had only been sent to bombard Midway and would be recalled shortly. Unfortunately, the contact report led to confusion and allowed the main group to sail west for home with no further attacks. On the positive side, a Japanese lookout spotted *Tambor* and in the maneuvering to avoid *Tambor*, two cruisers collided and were significantly damaged. US aircraft sank one of the cruisers soon after and further damaged the other. **Philippine Sea (AKA the Great Marianas Turkey Shoot) and the Invasion of Saipan:** Both the Americans and the Japanese expected that the invasion of Saipan, Tinian and Guam would trigger a major battle at sea. Japan was still looking for the major victory at sea that would regain control of the western Pacific. Our submarines were deployed to locate the Japanese fleet, hopefully to inflict some damage on the fleet and to intercept their supply lines. Even before the battle began, submarine warfare had reduced the fuel available to the Japanese fleet. Due to that shortage, Japanese pilots had limited training and air time. Because he had limited fuel at his disposal, Admiral Toyoda had to be sure of the American objectives before sailing and was slow to implement his defensive plan. The prior damage inflicted by submarines had already put the Japanese at a disadvantage. *Pampanito* had been assigned lifeguard duty near Yap Island when our aircraft attacked the Japanese bases there. In preparation for the invasion of Saipan, we wanted to put those nearby airfields out of commission. In preparation for the invasion, submarines were assigned to clear the area near Saipan of Japanese supply ships. Some examples are: - The *Tang* spotted a supply convoy of five vessels in the vicinity of the Marianas and sank two of them. A day or two later they sank three more supply ships. - *Sunfish* sank two other cargo ships. - *Trout* found a convoy bringing three regiments of Japanese troops to the Marianas. *Trout* sank one ship and damaged another. Of the 4,000 reinforcements troops, only 1,720 made it ashore and a third of those went straight to a hospital. - As part of a wolfpack, *Pintado* and *Shark* sank three large cargo ships with terrible losses to the embarked soldiers. Intelligence about the location and progress of the Japanese fleet was provided by: - *Redfin* spotted the Japanese fleet with its six carriers plus battleships and cruisers as they departed Tawi Tawi headed for Saipan. - *Harder* had also reported three battleships in the same area, including one of the super battleships of the *Musashi* class. - *Flying* *Fish* reported three carriers and battleships as they exited the San Bernardino Straight in the Philippines. - *Seahorse* reported four warships and six other ships east of Surigao Straight, near the Philippines. - *Cavalla*, relieving *Seahorse*, reported three tankers but couldn't get close enough to attack. This provided enough information for Admiral Spruance to get a clear picture of Japanese intentions. It also helped Admiral Lockwood deploy his submarines in the area. *Cavalla* was then able to reestablish contact and make another report. Two Japanese carriers were sunk during the battle by submarines including: - Shortly after the Japanese had launched aircraft against the American carriers, *Albacore* managed to hit the Japanese carrier *Taiho* with a single torpedo. Although this would not normally be a fatal blow, the *Albacore* got some help from the Japanese damage control parties. The *Taiho* was opened up internally in order to ventilate smoke and gasoline vapors. Instead, the gasoline fumes ignited and the resulting fires wrecked the carrier. - A few hours later, *Cavalla* found the carrier *Shokaku* and fired six torpedoes at her. Three of them hit the Japanese carrier and set off secondary explosions among the torpedo planes being fueled on the hangar deck. *Shokaku* actually sank about thirty minutes before *Taiho*. These were two of the largest and best carriers that the Japanese had remaining. In the battle of the Philippine Sea, the Japanese lost a total of three carriers and over 400 aircraft. As at Midway, they again lost most of their seasoned pilots. The Japanese would never be able to send an effective carrier task force to sea after this.",

    "question": "Leyte Gulf:",
    "answer": "This was intended by the Japanese to be a gun battle. The plan was to divide the Japanese forces into three groups. The Central and Southern Forces were to break through the American forces and destroy the landing fleet taking back the Philippines. The Northern Force was a decoy to draw the American carriers away from the landing fleet. The submarines *Darter* and *Dace* reported contacts with three cruisers, possibly of the Central Force. At the time, they were not able to get into position to attack. Very early the next day, they rendezvoused to discuss plans when they were interrupted by a radar contact. This was a much larger group of contacts which turned out to be the very large Central group. The submarines set a trap and sank the heavy cruisers *Atago* and *Maya* and seriously damaged the heavy cruiser *Takao*. The *Bream* was credited with damage to the heavy cruiser *Aoba*, which had been detached from the Central Force as a troop movement detachment. The *Angler* and *Guitarro* were able to report the movement of the Central Force and confirm that it was headed to the San Bernardardino Straight. After this, there was no further involvement of our submarines with the Southern or Central Forces. The Northern group did attract Admiral Halsey with his large carriers and fast battleships. After the carrier pilots engaged the Japanese ships, our submarines in the area were free to engage with any targets they could find. The *Halibut* found what was thought to be a battleship. Captain Galantin fired six torpedoes and believed he had five hits. He later observed what he believed to be a capsized hull and two escorts picking up survivors. However, he was not credited with the sinking. The *Haddock* observed gun flashes and star shells from a surface engagement by our cruisers. Captain Roach \"decided not to get into this melee until our forces quit, then try to catch them (Japanese ships) on the way home.\" Unfortunately, by then the targets were out of range. The *Jalleo* picked up two targets on radar and fired four torpedoes at a cruiser from close range. He saw three hits accompanied by bright flashes. When he surfaced 30 minutes later, there was nothing in sight. That was because the target, the *Tama*, had sunk in plain sight of the *Pintado*.",

    "question": "NOTES:",
    "answer": "1. A depth charge is a bomb dropped or thrown from an anti-submarine vessel. It consists of a few hundred pounds of explosive and a pressure switch to detonate it. The charge sinks down until it reaches the depth set in the pressure switch and then explodes. A depth charge explosion within 50 feet of the boat can do significant damage. Within 25 feet, the hull will most likely rupture and the boat will probably sink. 2. The reduction gear is between the main motors and the propeller shaft. It allows the motor to run at a higher, more efficient speed while the propeller turns more slowly. Damaged reduction gears tend to make noise and can give away the boat's location. Main motors were redesigned to eliminate the reduction gear. That was completed late in the war by an engineer named LCDR Hyman Rickover. Yes, that Rickover. 3. Bioluminescence is cause by certain plankton which come toward the surface to feed at night. These plankton glow when disturbed. A ship, torpedo or even a dolphin passing through the plankton will leave a glowing trail of where they had been until the plankton settle down again. It is very disconcerting for a submarine, which depends on stealth, to discover that it is leaving a glowing arrow in the water behind it. 4. A night surface attack was often preferred as long as there wasn't a bright moon. Submarines were painted a specific dark gray color on vertical surfaces to make them hard to see at night. Sonar did not usually find and identify a submarine on the surface, and most Japanese escorts did not have radar until late in the war. References: USS Pampanito Killer-Angel by Gregory F.
