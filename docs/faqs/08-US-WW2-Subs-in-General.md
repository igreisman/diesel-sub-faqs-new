US WW2 Subs in General

**How many submarines did we have in WW2?**

We started with about 50 operational submarines. We built 221 and we
lost 52. We ended the war with 179 boats in service with about 40 more
in sea trials or still being completed. Definitions vary so it can be
difficult to get consistent, definitive numbers. Contracts for many more
of the Balao and Tench class boats were cancelled when it became
apparent that they would not be needed for the war.

This refers only to operational boats. At the beginning of the war, we
still had some old R-class boats and most of those were being used for
training. Some S-class boats were being used for training while others
were still operational boats at that time. (The R-boats go back to the
early part of WW1 and the S-boats were built during and right after that
war.) However, both classes had shorter range and many other
limitations. The operational S-boats would become training boats as new
construction could replace them.

**What was built after the R and S class boats?**

We had built about 40 "fleet boats" in the 1930s. This includes the
Porpoise, Perch, Salmon, Sargo and Tambor classes. These are the boats
that were built as we incorporated new technologies and what we learned
through operational experience. These boats were larger than the
S-boats, had greater range and carried more torpedoes. They were almost
the size of the Gato/Balao/Tench boats we built during the war and had
similar capabilities. A table, below, compares the sizes of our
submarine classes in WW2.

The fleet boats were operational at the start of WW2 along with some of
the S-boats. About 16 of the fleet boats were lost during the war. Many
of the others were still in active service at the end of the war.

> **NOTE:** The name "fleet boats" generally refers to the various

> these boats to sail with the fleet, but the name stuck. The name was
> sometimes also applied to the Gato, Balao and Tench classes that we
> built during the war.

There were also a few larger boats built after WW1. These larger boats
had two six-inch guns and they were slower and less maneuverable.
Therefore, they were more likely to be used for minelaying and for
special operations.

**What did we build during the war?**

The first of the newest WW2 classes, the Gato boats, were just being
commissioned when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. The design had
been set in 1939 and then we started building the new class. This class,
plus the Balao and Tench classes, were what we built during the war. All
three classes were very similar, other than the thickness of the hull,
and look the same to most observers. Sometimes all three classes are
referred to as Gato boats.

The Balao class boats had a thicker hull, at 7/8 inch rather than 11/16
inch. The hull was also strengthened to allow the boat to sit on the
bottom. The Tench class kept those improvements and had some ballast
tank piping rerouted for safety.

We completed a total of about 77 Gato class, 119 Balao class and 25
Tench class boats during and shortly after the war.

**What is a class of ships or submarines?**

A class is a group of ships built to essentially the same design. There
may be some small differences, often depending on the shipyard where the
vessel was built.

Classes are normally named after the first ship in the design that was
ordered. In an oddity, the USS *Drum* (SS-228) was the first Gato
submarine completed and commissioned. However, the USS *Gato* (SS-212)
was the first of the design ordered and the class is named after her.

**What did we do with our submarines at the end of the war?**

We had a huge Navy and decided to keep only about half of it active.
That included aircraft carriers, cruisers and destroyers as well as
submarines. Many of the ships we didn't keep were added to the reserve
fleet. Others were used in live weapons tests or sold to friendly
nations.

The boats that we kept active after the war would be upgraded starting
in the early 1950s. Guns were removed; the sail was streamlined and made
more efficient. Snorkels were added so that boats did not have to
surface to recharge the batteries or get fresh air in the boat. With a
snorkel, that could now be done from periscope depth. Later, there would
be a GUPPY program to improve battery capacity.

**What was the reserve fleet?**

The reserve fleet, sometimes called the "mothball fleet", were boats
that we kept on hand in case of new hostilities. The boats were
unloaded, covered in protective coatings and then sealed up as much as
practical. The idea was that it would be cheaper and faster to
reactivate these boats and upgrade them to current standards than it
would be to build new ones. Reserve fleets are being dismantled and the
ships sold for scrap.

**Did we use any of the reserve fleet submarines after WW2?**

We did. We reactivated and recommissioned a number of these boats for
service during the Korean Conflict in the early 1950s. A few of those
were kept active after the fighting ended but most went back into the
reserve fleet.

Other boats were sold to allies and friendly nations. Some of those were
given upgrades first. Other boats from the reserve fleet were used as
targets when testing new torpedoes. Still others were used in the atomic
bomb testing in the Pacific. Lastly, some of the WW2 boats became museum
submarines, such as the USS *Pampanito* (SS-383) here in San Francisco.

By the late 1950s, we were building nuclear powered submarines. That
meant that the WW2 boats were quickly outdated. By the end of 1973
nearly all of the World War 2 submarines had been decommissioned.
However, some of the new classes of diesel submarines that we had built
after the war were still in service in the U. S. Navy as late as 1988.

Two of our WW2 submarines, the USS *Tusk* (SS-426) and the USS *Cutlass*
(SS-478) were transferred to Taiwan and are still in service as of 2023.
However, since they are now 80 years old, they are limited in their
capabilities. Taiwan is now building new, non-nuclear submarines.

It seems rather ironic that most of our submarines were built in
shipyards on the Atlantic side of the country while nearly all served in
the Pacific.

> Groton. In this, we actually take after the British. Their former

> harbor in Gosport.

**Why was there such a difference in the numbers of boats built in each
yard?**

The first reason is that Electric Boat and the Portsmouth Naval Ship
Yard were established yards and could ramp up production more quickly.
They were experienced in building submarines. The Manitowoc Shipbuilding
Company had not been building Navy ships at all. They did not finalize
their first contract, for just 10 boats, until October of 1940.

Mare Island Naval Shipyard was an experienced yard and had built
submarines as well as ships of various types. However, it soon became
apparent that the shipyard would be needed for submarine overhauls. That
limited the amount of new submarine construction that could be
completed.

**What is different about a naval shipyard, like the ones in Portsmouth
and Mare Island?**

Naval shipyards are owned and operated by the government. Costs for
building ships are based on the total costs for labor, materials and
overhead. Civilian shipyards, such as Electric Boat and Manitowoc
Shipbuilding, are profit making ventures. They add a reasonable profit
to their estimated costs when entering into a contract with the
government.

**How much did these submarines cost?**

The numbers vary. The typical cost for boats from Portsmouth or Mare
Island during WW2 is generally quoted at \$5 million. The first contract
for the boats from Manitowoc was for about \$3 million and the second
was for \$3.2 million per boat, plus incentives for early completion.
That doesn't necessarily mean that the boats built in the civilian yards
are that much less expensive. It seems unlikely that the accounting is
consistent. For example, did the private yards include the costs for the
propellers, engines and batteries, which the shipyards didn't actually
build? It seems likely that Navy yards included all costs while the
contracts with the private yards may have only included the hull,
wiring, piping, and installation of the engines and other large items.

These prices are in 1940s dollars. \$5 million in 1943 would be the
equivalent of over \$100 million today.

**How long did it take to build these submarines?**

in the period between the two world wars, it could take as much as two
to three years to complete a submarine. There was little urgency and we
were likely making changes to the designs as we learned more about how
prior boats performed. There was also some incentive to take longer in
order to improve planning and to maintain staffing levels in the
shipyards. However, by the late 1930s, as the war was on the horizon and
more boats were being ordered, the typical time to complete a submarine
was down to about a year and a half.

When the war had broken out in Europe, contracts were being let to begin
building ships to either keep us out of the war or to be able to fight
it effectively. Construction had already begun, but not on a pace that
would soon be needed.

By the time we were in the war, in December of 1941, construction had
already started to speed up. Submarine designs had been frozen and soon
shipyards were operating 24 hours per day, seven days per week.
Shipyards would also have multiple boats under construction at any one
time. There would be some boats where the work had just begun and others
farther along but still in drydocks. Others may have been launched but
still needed a few a few months for more work to be completed. During
the war, boats would usually be commissioned less than a year after
construction began.

For example, construction on the *Pampanito* began on March 15, 1943.
She was commissioned on November 6, 1943. The submarine USS *Picuda*
(SS-382) was started on the same day, in the same drydock. They were
both launched on the 12^th^ of July. *Picuda* was commissioned about
three weeks before *Pampanito*. The Portsmouth Naval Shipyard
commissioned 32 of these submarines in 1944 alone.

> However, further sea trials may still be pending, along with the need

> issues are minor leaks, squeals or equipment not quite performing up
> to specifications. Most of these problems were resolved quickly.

**Were all of our newest WW2 submarines identical?**

As mentioned above, the three classes built during WW2 -- Gato, Balao
and Tench -- were very similar but not quite identical. The Balao and
Tench classes had thicker hulls and Tench boats had improved piping.
This enabled the Balao and Tench boats to have an approved depth limit
(test depth) of 400 feet or so vs. 300 feet for the Gatos.

In addition, there could be some slight variation in equipment location.
One tall skipper had the forward battery layout changed a bit so he
could have a longer bunk and be able to stretch out. These variations
were generally minor and were limited by functionality. Some changes
depended on the preferences of the captains, most often on the
commissioning (first) commanding officer.

One of the more apparent variations was the location of the large
cannon. It could be located either forward or aft of the sail. It
depended on whether the captain expected it to be used more often
offensively (usually forward) or defensively (aft of the sail). The gun
could get moved after commissioning if the current captain could talk
the shipyard into making the change during a refit or overhaul.

If you knew one of these boats - or even an older fleet boat - and
qualified on it, you wouldn't need much time at all to qualify on
another.

The differences among these three classes are not usually apparent to
most observers.

**How could they build submarines in Manitowoc on the Lake Michigan?**

The family-owned Manitowoc Shipbuilding Co. was an experienced shipyard.
They had built many ships, such as ore carriers, that operated on the
Great Lakes. When the war broke out, they wanted to assist in the war
effort and keep their staff employed. Although they had no experience
building submarines, and originally turned down the project, they worked
with Electric Boat in New London to prepare. They then built 28
submarines as a subsidiary of Electric Boat. The sailors in Manitowoc
boats really appreciated the high quality of the work.

Manitowoc Shipbuilding faced multiple challenges:

- In order to understand how each piping or wiring system fit with the
  whole and the order of installation for each one, the shipyard first
  built a full-sized model of a submarine out of wood.

- They were building ocean-going submarines in a fresh water
  environment. Fresh water weighs less than sea water meaning that it
  doesn't support as much weight. That, in effect, makes the completed
  submarine act as if it were tons heavier. They had to compensate for
  that so the boat wouldn't go straight to the bottom when it submerged
  the first time.

- Manitowoc submarines had to be launched sideways at commissioning due
  to the location on a river. That had never been done with these boats.
  There was concern that the sudden roll would damage some of the
  battery cells or that the boat would roll over. The engineers decided
  to launch without the battery cells installed and calculated the
  expected roll of the boat. The calculations were exactly correct and
  everything worked out well.

- Winter conditions on the Great Lakes are harsher than in Portsmouth,
  New London or Mare Island. The submarines undergoing sea trials in
  winter collected quite a bit of ice when on the surface. Much of that
  had to be removed before diving because of the added weight. It made
  the boat top heavy and less stable. This was also an issue, although
  to a lesser extent, in Portsmouth and New London.

- The boats then had to be sailed or transported to salt water.

In spite of all the things the Manitowoc shipyard had to do just to be
able to build these boats, they completed nearly all of them ahead of
plan and under budget. All but one of the boats were completed ahead of
schedule, entitling the shipyard to performance bonuses. They accepted
some of the bonuses but not all, since they thought it improper to make
too much profit during the war.

The shipyard was also building landing craft and heavy cranes at the
same time. That construction did not interfere with building submarines
or vice versa.

**How did Manitowoc get the boats to the ocean?**

Today, that would be straightforward. You would just sail the boats to
the Atlantic Ocean using the St. Lawrence Seaway. However, that wasn't
completed until 1959. In 1941, the locks in the Erie Canal could not
accommodate a ship longer than 300 feet and the locks on the St.
Lawrence River were even shorter. These submarines were nearly 312
feetlong. Therefore, the only water route available was through the
Chicago Sanitary Canal to the Illinois River and then the Mississippi
down to the Gulf of Mexico. (Yes, the Chicago sewage canal.) The
submarines would be towed through Chicago to Lockport, IL, loaded onto a
floating drydock (somewhat similar to a barge) and towed (pushed) down
the rivers. The Manitowoc shipyard needed to buy or build the drydocks.

Chicago had built drawbridges which would have allowed the drydock to
navigate the Sanitary Canal had the they all been finished. The bridges
were all functional for road traffic, but some of them didn't open. The
shipyard needed to complete the rest of the mechanisms to raise the
bridges.

The completed submarines on the floating drydocks still would not fit
under all the bridges on the Mississippi. To solve that, the periscope
shears, periscopes and radar masts were all removed before being loaded
on the drydocks before Chicago and were reinstalled in New Orleans.

One interesting story concerns a delay due to high water in spring on
the Mississippi. They had to wait several days for lower levels of water
in the river in order to get under bridges. There was no alternative
other than to tie the tug and floating drydock up to trees and wait. At
times, submarine builders needed to be as resourceful as submariners.

**Did "Rosie the Riveter" help build submarines?**

She certainly did. However, just for clarification, submarines were no
longer riveted as they had been in World War 1. They were welded. As a
result, it might be more accurate to say that "Wendy the Welder" helped
build submarines.

In any case, many women went to work in defense plants during the war.
Some did administrative work and others did drawing jobs. But many
others did the riveting and the welding. In fact, after initially
resisting having women in the shipyards, management often found that
women were better welders than the men. They were patient and some
skills, such as sewing, did make the training easier.

Two of Pampanito's engines were named, somewhat unflatteringly, after

**How big were our submarines in WW2?**

Most of our submarines were about the same size as the *Pampanito*. The
boats built during the war were almost 312 feet long (311 feet and 9
inches) and 27 feet wide at the widest. The pressure hull (sometimes
referred to as the people pipe) is 16 feet in diameter in most places,
around 275 to 280 feet long and is tapered at the ends. The Conning
Tower is about 20 feet long and 10 feet in diameter. Surface
displacement is about 1,550 tons and submerged is about 2,400 tons.

These newer boats had 10 torpedo tubes -- six forward and four aft --
and a full complement of torpedoes was 24.

They had four main engine/generator combinations, plus a smaller diesel
in the lower flats of the after engine room. The main engines produced
around 1,500 horsepower each, whether they were built by Fairbanks-Morse
or General Motors Winton.

The 40 or so "fleet boats" that were most of our submarines at the
outset of WW2 were about 10 feet shorter than the Pampanito, a bit
narrower and lacked the hard bulkhead to divide the engine rooms.

Some fleet boats had only eight torpedo tubes and others had ten.
Generally, they only carried 20 torpedoes but some could carry four more
in external containers. Their speed and range were comparable to the
Gato/Balao/Tench boats. Many of them served throughout the war. These
older boats had a higher loss rate than the Gato/Balao/Tench boats, due
to the length of time they were in service.

Initially, one significant drawback to these pre-war boats was in the
engines. Some of these boats were outfitted with 9-cylinder
Hooven-Owens-Rentschler (HOR) diesels. These engines turned out not to
be reliable. (The sailors thought they lived up to their name --HORs.)
The main problem was the failure of the timing chains. After a while,
these engines would be removed and replaced with the larger diesels
being used in the Gato boats.

The few S-class boats still in use at the beginning of the war were
significantly smaller and had less range. That is why they became
training boats as soon as we could afford to do so. They varied in size.
Length was generally from about 220 ft. to 240 ft. Beam was 21 to 22
feet. Displacement was 850 tons to 903 tons on the surface. Submerged
displacement was 1,060 to 1,230 tons. Maximum speed on the surface was
13 to 15 knots. Range was 5,500 nautical miles at 6.5 knots.

**How were US submarines named in WW2?**

Submarines were named after sea creatures. We can't just say they were
named after fish although most were, such as the *Perch*, *Bullhead*,
*Cod*, *Flying* *Fish* and *Halibut*. However, some were named after
marine mammals such as the *Whale*, *Porpoise*, *Finback* (a whale),
*Sea Cat* (an otter) and *Sealion*. Others were named after unusual sea
creatures, such as the *Seahorse* and *Skate*. Obviously, not all could
be named after ferocious sea creatures such as sharks or piranhas. We
even named subs the *Seadragon* and the *Trepang*, which are nudibranchs
or sea slugs.

The *Pampanito* is named after a smaller version of the pompano fish.
Pampanito, the fish, is about a foot long. It is a rather mild-mannered
fish that is brown or black on top and silver underneath.

**How many submarines did we lose in WW2?**

We lost a total of 52 submarines from all causes or about 23%. We lost
about 3,500 submarine sailors with their boats. This was the highest
loss rate of any of the major American services during the war.
(However, some of the smaller units, such as the Eighth Air Force over
Europe, may have had a higher loss rate.) As bad as this loss rate was
for our boats, most other countries lost a higher percentage of their
submarines

**How were they lost?**

The most frequent cause of our submarine losses was enemy action, either
to aircraft, anti-submarine warship attacks or a combination of the two.
Some were lost to mines. Over the course of the war, four were lost when
they ran aground on reefs although those crews were all rescued. At
least two boats were lost when they were struck by their own torpedoes
running in a circle, likely due to gyroscope failures. The first
submarine we lost in WW2, the USS *Sealion* (SS-195), was struck by
bombs while being repaired in the Philippines on one of the first days
of the war. In a few cases, we don't know why they were lost. It could
have been enemy action, mines, torpedo circular runs or even operational
errors.

A few notes about unusual losses:

- When the submarine USS *Pompano* (SS-181) was reported overdue, there
  was some confusion as to the name of the boat. It was sometimes
  reported in local papers as the *Pampanito*, which caused unnecessary
  grief for a few families until the error was corrected.

- Two older boats, the USS *Salmon* (SS-182) and USS *Halibut* (SS-232)
  were so badly damaged that they had to be taken out of operational
  service. *Salmon* became a training boat. *Halibut* was just scrapped.
  However, they are not included in the count of 52 since they did make
  it home.

- It has not been definitively established but the USS *Dorado* (SS-248)
  may have been sunk by one of our own PBM flying-boats when in a safe
  area. Other possible causes have been put forward as well but none
  have been substantiated.

- The USS *Corvina* (SS-226) is the only US boat known to have been sunk
  by a Japanese submarine. She was lost in November of 1943.

- The USS *Robalo* (SS-273) was probably sunk by a mine in 1944. 77 men
  died in the sinking. Apparently, four others survived, were captured
  and died in captivity.

- The USS *Seawolf* (SS-197) was sunk in late 1944 with 82 crewmen plus
  17 US Army personnel while en route to Samar. There was apparently a
  great deal of confusion in the area. In any case, *Seawolf* did not,
  or could not, respond to interrogation signals and was sunk by US
  forces.

The summary of our submarine losses in WW2 is as follows:

**Was everyone on board lost when a submarine sank?**

In WW2, that was often the case but not always. When we lost USS *S-36*
(SS-141)*,* USS *S-27* (SS-132)*,* USS *S-39* (SS-141) and USS *Darter*
(SS-227) because they had each run aground, all of the crews survived.
The crew of the *Darter* was transferred, *en masse,* to the USS
*Menhaden* (SS-377), then still under construction.

Nine other boats were lost with some, but not all, of the crew
surviving:

- The USS *Sealion* (SS-195) was lost at the very beginning of the war
  in the Philippines. Four men were killed when she was hit by two bombs
  from an aircraft attack. The boat was in maintenance. (One man from
  the USS *Seadragon* (SS-194) died from the shrapnel from *Sealion.*)
  The rest of the crew survived and were evacuated from the Philippines.

- All 62 men of the crew of the USS *Perch* (SS-313) survived the damage
  to their boat. They also survived the scuttling of the boat but nine
  died in captivity.

- The USS *Grenadier* (SS-210) was damaged and then scuttled. All 76 men
  survived the loss of the boat, but four died in captivity.

- The USS *R-12* (SS-89) was recommissioned at the beginning of the war
  for use as a training boat. She was still being used as a training
  boat when she was lost in 1943. 42 men died when the boat went down,
  including two Brazilian Naval Officers. Five men were rescued and,
  fortunately, 18 others were on liberty that day and were not on board.

- The USS *S-44* (SS-155) was lost in 1943 along with 55 of her crew.
  Two crewmen survived.

- In a very unusual case, 43 men initially survived the loss of the USS
  *Sculpin* (SS-191). They were picked up by the Japanese and split into
  two groups and put aboard Japanese carriers for the trip to Japan. One
  of those carriers was sunk by the submarine USS *Sailfish* (SS-192)
  and only one of that group of *Sculpin* sailors survived. A total of
  just 21 men from the *Sculpin* survived the war. Captain John
  Cromwell, who was aboard *Sculpin* as wolfpack commander, had opted to
  go down with the boat rather than taking a chance that he might give
  away the Ultra secrets under interrogation. He was awarded the Medal
  of Honor posthumously.

- The USS *Tullibee* (SS-284) was sunk by her own torpedo when it made a
  circular run. 79 men were lost and just one survived. Approximately 23
  circular torpedo runs were reported in WW2, although there could have
  been more.

- 78 men were lost when the USS *Flier* (SS-250) was sunk by a mine.
  Eight others made it to Mantangula Island where they made contact with
  friendly natives. They radioed Australia, and the survivors were
  extracted by the USS *Redfin* (SS-272).

- The USS *Tang* (SS-306) was hit and sunk by a circular run of her own
  torpedo. It was her last torpedo at the end of the patrol. Nine men
  survived the sinking and taken prisoner. All nine survived the war
  including her captain, Richard O'Kane, who was later awarded the Medal
  of Honor.

In the other 39 cases, the entire crew went down with the boat.

**How were they able to design such a complex ship?**

Submarines evolved. They didn't need to be conjured up out of someone's
imagination as fully formed vessels in the 1930s and 40s. These WW2
submarines were the result of a rather lengthy process going back
hundreds of years. Here is a quick summary, up to the beginning of WW2.
A more detailed version of submarine history is included as Appendix 13?

The idea of a submersible, naval warship appears to go back at least to
the reign of Alexander the Great. That was 300 years BCE (before the
common era). Leonardo De Vinci also designed a submarine, although it
did not appear to be workable.

The first attack in American submarine history was on a British ship
during our Revolutionary War. It was attempted by David Bushnell's
submarine *Turtle.* Like most of the designs at this time, *Turtle* was
a small, one-man submersible powered by the man inside it. The weapon
was called a torpedo but it was what we think of as a mine. It was to be
attached to the target and detonated after the submersible pulled away
to a safe distance. Because the speed and endurance were so limited, the
attempted attack against a British ship failed.

The *USS Alligator* was the first known U. S. Navy submersible,
purchased during the Civil War. (The *Turtle*, above, was apparently
operated by the Continental Army.) It was also small and powered by the
12 men inside, first with oars, then with a hand-cranked propeller.
*Alligator* did not contribute to the Civil War effort, and sank off
Cape Hatteras with no loss of life in 1863. (Wikipedia)

The first successful attack by a submarine was the sinking of the *USS
Housatonic.* The Confederate submarine *CSS Hunley* successfully
approached the *Housatonic* and detonated the spar charge. The
*Housatonic* sank. Unfortunately, the *Hunley* was not able to get far
enough away and the crew was all killed when the boat sank. This was the
third crew of thee *Hunley* to die when the vessel sank.

A breakthrough occurred in the late 1800s. Robert Whitehead had
developed his motor torpedo, a self-propelled device that was a natural
fit with the submarines being built. Shortly after that, at about the
turn of the century, John Holland and Simon Lake were able to create
workable submarines here in the US. Their boats had gasoline engines and
were no longer dependent on human power. They were larger and Holland's
boats carried torpedoes.

It took years but Holland was finally able to get the Navy to approve
his designs and buy his submarines. These would be the first
mechanically-powered attack submarines. When he ran short of capital
because of all the delays, Isaac Rice came to his rescue. Rice had been
looking for more applications for his battery business. Submarines were
a logical application for batteries since that was their source of power
when submerged. Rice bought out Holland's patents and the rest of his
financial interests. Holland was eventually squeezed out of the company
altogether. This was the beginning of the Electric Boat Company which
still builds US submarines today. It was also the last of Holland's
designs.

Some nations bought Holland's boats. Others bought the designs and
developed their own boats. Britain and Germany built their own
submarines based on what they learned from the Holland designs and
Lake's work. Many navies wanted to have their own input into the designs
of their boats. Holland and Lake did their own designs and offered the
boats for sale.

By the time of World War I, there had been many improvements. Boats had
periscopes and both bow and stern planes for depth control. They were
larger. They were still somewhat primitive but more habitable. Germany,
in particular, had created very effective boats. This became very
apparent in September of 1914, only about six weeks into WW1, when Otto
Weddigen in command of the *U-9* attacked three obsolete British
cruisers in the space of about an hour. All three sank rather quickly
with the loss of almost 1,500 men.

Germany then proceeded to show how effective a weapon of war a submarine
could be. They almost severed the supply lines to Britain and France.
British ships could find German submarines with ASDIC, which we call
sonar. However, they were still developing weapons to attack subs in the
depths. Escorts could only hope to ram submarines or force them to the
surface and attack with guns. Sometimes, it was good enough to just keep
the U-boats down and unable to attack while the convoy escaped.

Eventually, the Allies managed to defeat the Central Powers on land and
end the war. As the spoils of war, the Allies received examples of the
German U-boats. After the war, when we compared our new submarines to
the German U-boats, we realized how limited our boats were. One analysis
found that in every category the German submarines were superior. In
many aspects they were far superior. We had no choice but to begin the
work of improving our designs.

The two most basic issues were the need to determine what types of
submarines we should have and then finding an appropriate and effective
means of propulsion for them. Some of the other challenges we had to
address were the quality of periscopes, communications, detection gear
(sonar) and habitability over long distances

Perhaps the most important outcome of the analysis in 1926 was the
creation of the Submarine Officers Conference. This was a group of
experienced submarine officers that included senior commanders, naval
engineers and officers who had commanded boats. For the first time,
American submarine officers would have input into the needs of the
submarine force and the designs of the submarines themselves.

By 1934, they had settled on a design of approximately 1,500 tons
surface displacement. This would provide the range needed to carry the
fight across the Pacific and Atlantic if needed. The boats needed to be
large enough to carry the fuel for a long journey and to carry enough
torpedoes to make the trip worthwhile. This would be the eventual size
of the Gato/Balao/Tench class boats of WW2, such as the *Pampanito*.

The propulsion issue wasn't easily solved. The surface navy at the time
was primarily steam-driven and had difficulty imagining anything else.
However, steam isn't practical in a submarine dependent on fossil fuels.
Restarting a steam plant after being submerged takes way too long.
Keeping a steam plant running while submerged makes the submarine too
hot for the crew.

Gasoline was also impractical as a fuel source. It is too volatile; it
tends to catch fire too easily and the fumes in a closed space are toxic
and can be explosive.

The answer came from improvements in diesel engines. Then it was a
question of the cost of designing and producing these specialized
engines. Fortunately, railroads were also looking for diesel engines
that would fit in their locomotives and produce a similar amount of
power. The railroad engines were similar enough to those for our
submarines to spread development and manufacturing costs.

The Submarine Officers Conference opted to design the power transfer,
from the engines to the propeller shafts, as mostly electrical. On our
WW2 boats, the engines are not connected physically to the propellers.
They were essentially electric submarines with four large
engine/generator combinations to provide the electrical power. The
arrangement and the flow of power is:

\[Engine\] \[Generator\] 🡪 \[Cubicle\] 🡪 \[Main Motors\] \[Reduction
Gear\] 🡪 \[Propellor Shaft\]

This arrangement provides multiple advantages:

1.  There is no clutch to be engaged or to break down. A clutch would
    have been needed when diving to disconnect the engines from the
    propellor shafts.

2.  The engines can be run at a high speed for efficiency.

3.  The engines can run at a consistent speed even when the propellors
    need to turn slowly.

4.  It allows for four engines to be installed in two separate engine
    rooms.

5.  Four engines can provide a higher maximum speed for a larger
    submarine.

6.  Any combination of engines can be used depending on power
    requirements.

7.  The batteries can be recharged on a circuit separate from the one
    operating the boat.

At this point, we had a workable design for a long-range submarine with
space for sufficient fuel and weapons. It was also large enough to
provide some measure of habitability for the crew. This is what we built
just before and during WW2.
