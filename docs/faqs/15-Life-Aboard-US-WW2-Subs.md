Life Aboard WW2 US Subs

**What did a typical day at sea consist of?**

A typical day consisted of two four-hour shifts on watch plus time spent
for maintenance, paperwork, studying and training. The time between
08:00 and 16:00 (8 AM to 4 PM) would usually be a work day, when
maintenance, etc. would be completed. Twelve hours would not be unusual
for a regular workday, and it could be even longer if the sailor was
working toward his submarine qualification or studying for a promotion.

Sundays were a day of rest. As long as there were no attacks in progress
and no essential repairs, there would often be no routine work on those
days. In other words, on your day off you "only" stood eight hours of
watch.

This assumes that there were three watch sections and the crew would be
standing watches four hours on and then have eight hours off. If there
weren't three qualified watchstanders for a specific position, then
watches would be "port and starboard", meaning something like four hours
on and just four off duty. That would last until a third watchstander
could pass qualifications. The routine would also be adjusted a bit by
dogging the watch about once per week.

During the war, the routine would be changed by the need to carry out
long attacks on enemy ships or by attacks on the boat by enemy ships and
aircraft. Either of those could last many hours and would involve the
whole crew. That would naturally require changes to the normal schedule
and the boats would make whatever adjustments were needed for rest and
food.

There were a few instances of captains reversing the day so that the
crew would be working at night when the engines were running (and noisy)
and pulling fresh and, hopefully, cooler air into the boat. This would
also mean that the boat could be submerged - quieter and calmer - while
the crew is sleeping. This was usually done only when in the tropics. In
these cases, the workday would be from 20:00 to 04:00 (8 PM to 4 AM) and
meals would be offset by 12 hours. For example, breakfast would be
around 20:00 rather than at 08:00. The crew would then sleep during
daylight hours from 08:00 to 20:00.

**What did a typical day in port consist of?**

The typical workday would be from 08:00 to 16:00. That could be started
and ended earlier, called tropical hours, so that the crew isn't working
during the hottest part of the day. However, in WW2 it was often longer
than eight hours as men trained or got the boat ready for the next
patrol.

One third of the crew would remain on board overnight. This was so that
there were enough men on board in case of emergencies and so the boat
could get underway and change locations as needed. The duty section
would likely have some work to do to continue repairs or to clean up
after shipyard workers.

This assumes that there are no major problems to be corrected. If, for
example, engines needed to be overhauled, then the enginemen (motor macs
in WW2) would work more hours. Others in the crew might be assigned to
assist. The key thing is to get the boat ready for the next patrol. It
is important to remember that sailors in the Pacific area did not go
home at night. They may not see their families for a year or more at a
time.

**What is a "watch"?**

A watch is a normal shift for the routine operation the submarine. In
WW2, that was normally four hours in length with eight hours off before
the next watch. There would normally be three watch sections.

**What clock times did the Navy use in WW2.**

The Navy used, and still uses, a 24-hour clock. That is often called
military time or European continental time. Times between fifty-nine
minutes past noon and midnight are expressed by adding 12 to the time
that we are used to. Thus, 4 PM is 16:00; 8 PM is 20:00 and 11:59 PM is
23:59. Midnight is 00:00 and the hour until 01:00 is expressed as 00
plus the minutes. Noon is still 12:00.

"Zero Dark 30" is still any time in the very early morning when sensible
people are still asleep. This is true no matter where you are.

For our ships, times were normally local. As the boats headed west, the
clocks would be set back one hour as they crossed into the next time
zone. Just as we civilians do now, we would set the clocks back three
hours as we travel from the East Coast to the West Coast.

> **NOTE**: The German and Japanese navies did not use local time. Their
> clocks remained set to the time zones of their capitols.

If there were a need to specify a time regardless of where the submarine
might be, that would be stated as time zone Zulu. That is what most
civilians might know as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). This would be used,
for example, as the time for the cessation of hostilities, the end of
the war. That way, everyone everywhere would follow the given order to
cease fire at the same time.

**How does dogging the watch work?**

It means that one watch, usually the 12:00 to 16:00 is split into two
shifts of two hours each. This has the effect of changing everyone's
watch forward by four hours so no one stands the same watches all the
time. This would be done about once per week.

For example, the schedule for watch sections could be:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
            08:00    **12:00**   **14:00**   16:00    20:00    00:00    04:00
  -------- -------- ----------- ----------- -------- -------- -------- --------
  Day 6       1        **2**       **2**       3        1        2        3

  Day 7       1        **2**       **3**       1        2        3        1

  Day 8       2        **3**       **3**       1        2        3        1
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Watch section 2 in this example only stands half the 12:00 to 16:00
watch on day 7. Section 3 stands the last half of that watch, and will
stand all of it on day 8. This gives section 2 a break from always
standing mid-watches (00:00 to 04:00) and section 3 from always having
the 04:00 to 08:00 watches. Everyone now stands watch four hours earlier
than before we dogged the watch.

**What were the general living conditions on a submarine like this?**

Living conditions were fairly poor, including the following, some of
which are discussed further below:

- A shortage of bunks

- A lack of fresh air

- Possible temperature extremes

- Close quarters

- Limited fresh water

- A strong smell

- Little dedicated food storage space

- A lack of much personal storage

- A lack of privacy

**Since the crew size grew, but not the number of bunks, where did they
all sleep?**

There are enough bunks. There just aren't enough bunks for everyone to
have a bunk to themselves. The numbers vary a little based on the actual
number of men aboard for the patrol and the actual number of bunks
available. However, assume there were about 70 bunks and 80 men. In that
situation, 50 men would have their own bunks. The other 30 men would be
assigned with three men to two bunks. They were assigned so that one of
the three would be on watch at any time. That meant that if you were one
of the 30 junior men and you had an opportunity to sleep - your work was
done and your qualifications were current -- there was a bunk available.

That was the good news. The less good news, for these 30 junior men, was
that when they came off watch at midnight or 04:00 (AM) they would be
getting into the same bunk that their relief had just gotten out of. It
was called hot bunking for a reason. To further put that in context, we
think the boats rarely were cooler than 90 degrees Fahrenheit if they
were in the tropics as most of them were.

There was the possibility of some good news. If the captain had an
opportunity and fired torpedoes from the after torpedo tubes, bunking
could improve. Reload torpedoes would be moved into the tubes, which
were always kept full if possible. Now, for every torpedo fired, you
could make two or three bunks on each empty skid. For every bunk that is
created in this way, three sailors would no longer be hot bunking.

**Is there a best place to sleep?**

Submarines are relatively noisy at night. Engines are running and
batteries are being charged. The boat is on the surface plowing through
waves. People are on watch, operating the submarine. All of that makes
noise. Red lights help to make it easier to sleep, but the boat can't go
completely dark. As a result, nothing will be as quiet and dark as your
bedroom at home.

Most areas seem to have advantages and drawbacks. The forward torpedo
room is farthest from the engines, so that noise is at the lowest level
here. However, you do hear the bow crashing through the waves. In
addition, the bow, as well as the stern, experience the most vertical
motion - up and down - due to the swells of the ocean.

The after torpedo room has a little separation from the engines but does
have the propellor shafts running under it with the screws not far
behind. That does generate noise while on the surface.

The after battery -- crews' berthing -- will probably have the least
vertical motion. However, it is next to the forward engine room which
will normally have at least one engine running at night. It also has a
large fan pulling air out of the battery well during the battery charge.
With 36 bunks in this space, the chances of at least one sailor snoring
like a chain saw are close to 100%.

> **NOTE**: The area on the port side of the crew's berthing, away from

> 18. That area on the port side, called Hogan's Alley, could then be a

The top bunks are usually preferred since no one would step on your bunk
as they climb up to theirs. Just watch out for all those little valves
in the after corners of the crew's berthing area. You don't want to wake
up with a start and imprint those valves on your forehead.

The forward battery is likely to be one of the better places to sleep.
There are still engine, fan and wave noises, as well as lights. But this
space doesn't have the worst of any of the disadvantages. The key may be
to become an officer or a chief petty officer so you can have a bunk in
this compartment.

**Is it ever truly quiet for sleeping?**

Finding a truly quiet place to sleep is very unlikely. There is constant
activity on the boat. The engines are probably running at night and you
can hear them, perhaps at a low noise level, anywhere on the boat. The
battery is being charged. The electricians will go in and out of the
battery wells to check on the specific gravity, to monitor progress of
the charge. The boat is also on the surface which adds the noise of the
boat cutting through the waves. If the swells are small, the rocking of
the boat can help you get to sleep. If the swells are large, you may
find yourself sleeping in odd positions so you can stay in your bunk.

The key here is to get used to the noise and light quickly. It also
helps to be tired after a long workday.

**What kept you from falling out of your bunk in heavy seas?**

This was mostly up to you. Find a sleeping position that was spread out
enough so that you wouldn't be as likely to roll over unintentionally.
You may not get a very good night's sleep but it is possible to sleep
this way.

In big storms, captains would sometimes go deep for 12 hours or so. This
would get the boat below most of the wave motion. Then the crew would
have some time to eat a meal and get some sleep before going back up on
the surface to fight the storm.

In very heavy seas, you may have to strap yourself into your bunk in
order to stay put.

**How deep do you have to go to get below the effect of waves?**

Naturally, this depends on the size of the waves. However, it quickly
becomes calmer than being on the surface. Even periscope depth is
somewhat calmer than the surface. A depth of 100 feet makes a
significant difference. Going to 150 or 200 feet would be below most
wave action. Captains would go down to 300 or 400 feet in big storms and
that would usually be calm enough. This would allow the crew to eat,
digest their food and get some rest.

Modern submarines need to be at 200 feet frequently to pick up any
messages addressed to them. They have reported being bounced around
quite a bit at 200 feet when they were in typhoons. Remember that waves
in typhoons can be as high as 50 to 90 feet.

**What was the largest number of men on a US WW2 submarine?**

Again, the Gato/Balao/Tench boats generally had 80 to 85 men aboard. For
the normal crew size, the largest number was likely the *Narwhal* and
*Nautilus*, which were large, slow submarines built in the late '20s.
(These boats were about 35 feet longer, 6 feet wider and almost twice
the displacement of the Gato/Balao/Tench boats.) They usually had crews
of about 90 men. That increased briefly to nearly 100 in the middle of
the war and then returned to about 90. These submarines had two six-inch
guns and were often used for minelaying and transport of small units of
guerillas and regular troops.

However, there were cases when boats had extra passengers as the result
of special operations, rescues or lifeguard duty. A small sampling
includes:

- USS *Seawolf* (SS-1977) was lost in1944 with 82 crew and 17 US Army
  personnel aboard.

- At one point, USS *Narwhal* (SS-167) picked up 32 evacuees, including
  eight women and two children.

- Overall, submarines rescued 504 downed aviators during the war with
  USS *Tigrone* (SS-419)-rescuing 31 in a single patrol to break the
  record of 22 by USS *Tang* (SS-306). Some rescued airmen stood watches
  while on the boats.

- USS *Gato* (SS-212), in 1943, evacuated 27 children, nine mothers and
  three nuns from Bougainville.

- In September of 1944, USS *Pampanito* (SS-383) rescued 73 British and
  Australian soldiers in the South China Sea. The rescued soldiers were
  aboard for about five days. *Sealion* (SS-315) participated in the
  same rescue, picking up 52 soldiers.

- When the USS *Darter* (SS-227) ran aground on a coral reef in late
  1944, her crew was rescued by the USS *Dace* (SS-247). With two full
  crews aboard. there were likely about 160 sailors aboard the *Dace*
  for approximately one week.

- In February, 1942, the USS *S-38* (SS-143) picked up 58 survivors from
  the British destroyer HMS *Electra*, sunk the day before at the Battle
  of the Java Sea. This is particularly noteworthy because the normal
  crew size is only about 42 men.

**How could you all move quickly when going to battle stations?**

Submarine sailors quickly learn to get past each other in the narrow
passageways. However, there wasn't necessarily all that much movement
going to battle stations, particularly during WW2. First, you often
worked and slept near your battle station. For example, torpedomen
usually stood watch, worked, slept and had their battle stations in the
torpedo rooms.

In addition, sailors typically had plenty of warning during the war that
the captain was planning to attack. Smoke from potential targets could
be spotted at least ten or fifteen miles away. Smoke would be seen well
before the ships themselves. If the target would be cargo ships or
tankers, which usually proceeded at 10 to 12 knots, the tracking party
would be called away first. That could be an hour or more before going
to battle stations.

In addition, there are very few secrets on a submarine. There is barely
enough room for a private thought, much less a secret. Word about a
possible attack would spread through the crew quickly. Sailors would
then have plenty of opportunity to drift toward their battle stations
before the alarm would be sounded.

**What is "battle stations"?**

Battle stations is the condition when the ship is expected to go into
battle. Every position is manned, usually by the best operators
available. Crew members not at a specific battle station would be
available as reserves or for damage control.

On submarines, there could be different assignments for battle stations
surfaced, battle stations guns or just battle stations (which assumes
attacking while submerged.)

**What is a "battle station"?**

It is an individual's job when the submarine went into combat. Some of
the crew had different stations depending on whether the boat was
attacking on the surface, preparing to use the deck guns, or submerged.
This would normally be related to one's rating or specialty. It could be
as one of the primary operators or as a back-up or available for damage
control.

**Who was responsible for damage control?**

Most large Navy ships have dedicated sailors for what is known as damage
control parties. This is in addition to their regular assignments. Their
role, in the event of a mechanical casualty or drill, is to report to
the assigned damage control locker. From there, they will grab the
appropriate gear and proceed to combat the problem.

These submarines did not have assigned damage control parties. The
sailors who happen to be in the compartment where the problem occurs are
the damage control party. That is why every submarine sailor has to
learn damage control techniques. And that is why every submarine sailor
needs to know the basics of every system on the boat. They have to know
how to isolate the problem and combat it effectively. This is all a part
of submarine qualification and earning their dolphins.

**What was a tracking party?**

The tracking party is the part of the battle stations crew that is
determining the location and direction of the potential targets while
still a distance away. This could be an hour or more before the rest of
the crew went to battle stations, depending on the speed of the targets.
The information gathered at this time would eventually be the basis for
the attack and the final course of the torpedoes.

The captain and executive officer were key members, of course. You would
also want the sonar and radar stations manned by your best people. The
torpedo data computer (TDC) would be used to track the targets' progress
and to begin to develop the firing solution for the torpedoes.
Therefore, the TDC operator(s) would be included, along with anyone else
the captain deemed relevant.

**Where did they store all the oxygen for so many people?**

They didn't. These submarines did not have the capability to make or
store large quantities of oxygen or to remove CO2. (Modern submarines
do, and that's why they can be submerged for two or three months at a
time.) In the WW2 boats, the air that they were breathing was the same
air they had been breathing since they submerged. That air was intended
to last 16 to 18 hours. Since most of the crew smoked, let's call it 16
hours. The normal procedure would be to surface every night to get fresh
air in the boat.

**How do you get fresh air into the boat? Where does the oxygen come
from?**

The best way to get breathable air in the boat is to run the engines to
charge the battery. (To say it is *fresh* air may be a bit of a
stretch.) The air system is set up so that most of the air for the
engines goes straight to the engine rooms. However, some of it goes to
the ends of the boat and gets pulled toward the engine rooms, refreshing
the air in all the spaces. Running the low-pressure blower to push the
last of the water out of the ballast tanks would use the air in the
middle of the boat, also pulling fresh air in, this time through the
conning tower hatch. The same thing would happen if the air compressors
in the pump room were running to recharge the air banks.

The routine was to be on the surface every night. This would hopefully
top off the battery for the next day while freshening the air in the
boat. Being on the surface each night also allowed the boats get their
messages and, if the skies were cooperative, get a position fix using
stars at dusk and again at dawn.

If the boat had to remain submerged more than 16 hours - usually because
it was being attacked - there were one-time measures that could be used.
The first of those were the six green oxygen bottles and the many CO2
absorbent cans in the overheads. The silver-colored cans in the
overhead, labeled "DO NOT PAINT", are the CO2 absorbent, typically
lithium hydroxide. These will give you a couple more hours of breathable
air.

After that, the main option was to bleed air from the high-pressure air
banks into the boat. This would pressurize the boat somewhat, but would
improve the O2 and CO2 percentages. Even if the air in the boat were
doubled, to two atmospheres, decompression would not be an issue. It
would about the same as swimming and diving down to about 25 feet. To be
clear, this air from the air banks isn't to be confused with fresh air,
but it is air that allows the crew to survive.

**Were these submarines hot inside?**

Most of them were, but that depended on where they were. If they were in
the tropics, we suspect that the boats were rarely if ever below 90
degrees. And most of our boats were in the tropics for the majority of
the time. The first issue is that the water temperature is 80 to 85
degrees. The next one is that the boat is constantly generating heat
mainly from cooking, the engines and from charging or discharging the
battery. In the tropics, the engine rooms would easily reach 100
degrees.

When the engines were shut down when submerging, the cooling water to
the engines would also shut down. Then the engine rooms could reach 120
degrees and the rest of the boat could be 110. It would take some time
for the warm ocean waters to cool the boat back down.

There is air conditioning, but it was really little more than a
dehumidifier. Freidman, Page 200. It helped but didn't really cool the
boat that much.

If the boats were in northern or southern latitudes, the temperatures
could be more moderate. This was particularly true in spring and fall.

If the boats were operating off Alaska, they might actually be rather
cold. The Japanese occupied the last two islands in the Aleutian chain
at the time of the Battle of Midway. After that, we often had a
submarine in the area monitoring any Japanese activity. In that area,
the air and water temperatures may well be in the low 30s. If so, the
boat would be cool or cold. The crew might be wishing for some of that
excess tropical heat. It would also be cold in the boats during the
winter if they were being tested during sea trials off Manitowoc, WI;
Portsmouth, NH; or New London, CT.

**Weren't the boats crowded?**

Submariners didn't usually think so. No one thought a submarine would be
spacious when they volunteered. They knew it was small and would be all
closed up when submerged. (The non-submarine admirals who complained
that the new designs were too plush seemed to think otherwise.)
Therefore, the boats did not seem that crowded to the crews.

Still, it's really a matter of what you get used to and the crews
quickly became accustomed to the conditions. It simply became the new
normal. As Fletcher Pratt wrote about submariners in "The Navy's War",
page 140: "It was a club of individuals with an almost incredible
ability to treat every circumstance as normal."

"Killer-Angel quote about normal

Even though the crew could become accustomed to the close quarters, that
didn't make it ideal. Of course, carrying a significant number of extra
passengers, such as rescued personnel or special operations troops would
make it more crowded. The crew might have to work a bit harder to make
it seem normal.

**There are showers on board. How often could the crew take showers?**

Rarely, if ever. On a submarine, there isn't enough fresh water for
everyone to take showers regularly. This varied from boat to boat, but
the stills only produced so much fresh water. They were also famously
unreliable. If both stills were working at full capacity, they would
produce about 5,000 gallons per week each. They were rarely both working
at capacity and, in the patrol area, you would not use the stills when
submerged. They use too much power and make too much noise.

The first 500 gallons each week has to be distilled twice for the
battery. The next claim for fresh water is the internal cooling systems
for the engines. However, the engines don't normally require much water
each week. The next claim would be by the cooks. Water is needed for
coffee or bug juice (a sort of Kool-Aid), to cook your food and to wash
the dishes. That leaves only a few gallons per day for the crew to brush
their teeth, shave if they want to, and wash up a bit.

We would like to have the cooks and the pharmacist mate (medic) shower
about once a week. With so little water left after that, the rest of the
crew would not normally take showers. They might only get a bucket of
water periodically from the air conditioning condensate to wash out
skivvies and then take a sponge bath. Since that water is extracted from
the air in the boat, it will almost certainly have a thin sheen of oil
on top.

Any showers would be "navy showers". Fresh water is precious throughout
the fleet, even where it is more plentiful than it was on submarines. A
navy shower means that the sailor wets down and then turns the water
off. He or she then soaps and lathers up. Then the water is turned back
on to rinse off. Ideally, the total water usage is no more than three
minutes.

San Francisco residents tend to use water efficiently and that is still
about 60 gallons per day. That would be over 5,000 gallons **per day**
for 80 people plus the water needed for the battery. Submarines often
didn't make that much water in a week.

**Why not take salt water showers?**

An occasional salt water shower wouldn't be a problem. However, regular
showers with sea water irritates the skin. Soon the sailors would be
scratching themselves and raising welts with infections possible. Since
this isn't a terribly good idea, the boat is not plumbed to have salt
water in the showers.

**If no one could take showers, didn't the submarine smell bad?**

Absolutely. Diesel submarines stank, especially when at sea.

To clarify, it was true that most of the crew did not take showers. It
would vary from boat to boat, but there just wasn't enough fresh water
for everyone to take showers regularly. For obvious reasons, it was
preferable that the cooks and the pharmacist mate (medic) be able to
take showers, perhaps weekly. The rest of the crew may have gotten a
bucket of water occasionally from the air conditioning condensate. They
could use that to wash out skivvies and then take a sponge bath. Humans
contributed significantly to the smell.

But human bodies were not the only source of odors on submarines. There
was the all-pervasive smell of diesel, other oils and engine exhaust
gasses. Paint smells linger too. Paint might be the largest component of
the odors on the *Pampanito* today. Most of the crew smoked since
cigarettes were given away free to servicemen in WW2. (To be more
accurate, most of the crew were active smokers and all the rest were
second hand smokers.) Yes, you could smoke in these confined spaces even
when submerged.

Finally, three of the four heads (toilets) drained to sanitary tanks.
The good news here is that these heads could usually be used when
submerged. The less good news is that when you drain something into the
sanitary tanks, you need to vent an equal amount of air. That would go
through charcoal filters before venting back into the boat, but that
only helped a little.

Yes, diesel submarines smelled bad.

**How could the sub sailors put up with the smell?**

There is some good news here. Diesel submarines are like gardenias,
night-blooming jasmine, tuberose and hydrogen sulfide. (Hydrogen sulfide
is a poisonous gas that smells like rotten eggs. However, submarines
aren't usually poisonous.) What all these things, and many others, have
in common with submarines is that after 15 to 30 minutes you stop
smelling it. Olfactory nerves get saturated and stop sending signals to
your brain. The nerves give up. You don't get used to the smell; you
stop smelling it. You only notice the new smells, like fresh-baked bread
and rolls at night.

This is what makes hydrogen sulfide so dangerous. You no longer smell it
but it can still kill you. The good news is that it is very rare to have
hydrogen sulfide on an operating boat since it develops in closed
spaces. We have very few of those and almost never go into them when at
sea.

Even if you are up on the bridge for a watch, the olfactory nerves don't
normally reset. You are still mostly "protected" when you come down off
the bridge.

**How much food could these boats carry?**

The boats were designed for patrols of about 75 days. Therefore, you
would carry at least as much food as the planned patrol would last.

**What kinds of food would it be?**

The menu was fairly basic. You were trying to keep 80 men happy even
though they were from different regions of the country with different
cuisines. Meat, potatoes and vegetable were the basic menus. That would
vary some with pasta and rice being on the menu at times. Fresh bread or
rolls were normal. In addition, the overnight baker may have made pies
or cakes.

After the first week at sea, there would be little fresh fruit,
vegetables or salads. Fresh food doesn't last that long, particularly
with limited cold storage. Cheese and fresh eggs didn't last long
either. Eggs would then be powdered after that. Much of the meat would
be frozen or canned.

**Where would it be stored? Where is the storage space?**

If we are talking about a patrol planned for 60 days or more, the simple
answer is: everywhere. Naturally, the limited pantry and cold storage
spaces are full. Large cans of coffee, sugar and flour would be stored
outboard of the engines. Eggs, butter and cheese would be stored in the
forward escape trunk for as long as they lasted. As warm as it might be,
it was likely the coolest place on the boat.

Canned goods would be stored wherever there was room as long as they
could be tied down securely and weren't in the way of operating
equipment. One logical place would be the berthing spaces in the battery
compartments. You would then be walking on your food -- the cases of
canned goods covered by cardboard or wood -- until the crew ate the food
down to the deck.

Sailors were often taking cans of peaches with them on patrol, as long
as the cans fit in their individual storage.

**What was the food like on a submarine?**

Since it has to be palatable to everyone aboard, it would tend to be
basic. Perhaps it could be best described as basic American food --
meat, vegetables and potatoes or perhaps rice or pasta.

Much of the food was canned although there was some freezer and
refrigerated space aboard. Fresh vegetables and fruit didn't last long.
Neither did fresh milk. Eggs and butter would be stored in the forward
escape trunk and might last a bit longer. (The escape trunk might be the
coolest place on a submarine but, if you are in the tropics, it wasn't
really very cool.) Bread, rolls and perhaps pies or cakes were baked
fresh each evening. Much of this is also true of surface ships. Food on
submarines was not much more limited than it was on surface ships.

To be fair, the crews might still grumble about the food. It has been
said that a sailor isn't happy unless he (or she) is complaining about
something. Sometimes the crew would drive the cooks crazy. On one
patrol, the main request might be for strawberries. The cooks would then
order more strawberries for the next patrol. Of course, the crew would
now want more peaches on that next patrol and would complain about being
stuck with all those stupid strawberries.

There was one overnight baker on a submarine who asked his shipmates to
write home for the recipe for his favorite cake. Get the recipe from his
shipmates' wives, girlfriends or mothers. Then, on that sailor's
birthday, he would bake that cake for dessert. This may not seem to be a
big deal, but it mattered for morale. Scaling up the recipe may not have
been as simple as it might seem since some ingredients, such as spices,
can require different proportions.

**Was the food really better than the rest of the Navy?**

Surprisingly, the food on submarines was the best food in the seagoing
Navy. That goes back to the earliest days on subs. President Theodore
Roosevelt visited one of our first submarines in 1901 or 1902. It was
apparent that there needed to be some added incentives to get sailors to
serve on those primitive boats. The answers were to increase the pay and
to increase the food allowance.

The food incentive was to increase the allowance per sailor on board.
The Navy provides a certain amount per enlisted sailor for meals each
day when assigned to a ship. The Navy provides a larger amount for those
sailors assigned to submarines. Therefore, the Supply Officer and the
cooks can order the special things from the standard stores list a
little more often. Examples might be that they could order more frozen
shrimp for shrimp cocktails or they could order better cuts of steaks
more often.

As a result of this incentive, the quality of the food on submarines
became a fairly big deal. There are stories of captains fighting over
good cooks, perhaps even physically. And you certainly didn't want to be
a bad cook on a submarine. You may not last long on the boats.

**How could everyone fit in that small space?**

There are four tables with three seats on each side. That means the
Crew's Mess seats 24, comfortably. The crew eats in sections, one third
at a time. Given the crew size of 80 sailors, minus the officers who eat
in the wardroom and the cook and mess cooks, that leaves 22 or so who
need to be fed at each seating.

**When were the meals?**

Meals were tied to the changes of the watch. That means breakfast was at
08:00, lunch was at noon, soup down was at 16:00 and dinner at 20:00.
This is done so that no one needs to miss a meal. The watch section
which will be going on duty eats first. During the time that the watch
changes, the section not involved eats next. (The change of the watch is
not instantaneous. The section coming on watch needs to be told about
the current situation and any upcoming changes or expected operations.)
The section coming off watch eats last.

**Is that an ice cream machine in the crew's berthing?**

Yes, it is. Early in the war, there was no capacity to make ice cream on
submarines. The boats may have been able to take small amounts with them
on patrol, but there is little freezer space for up to 75 days at sea.
Ice cream and oranges were the first things that sailors wanted when
they returned from patrol.

However, *Pampanito* has an ice cream machine. It is not clear when it
was installed, but it doesn't seem likely that she had one when she was
first built. The first machine wasn't installed on any submarine until
the last half of '43 and probably didn't become standard equipment until
'44.

The first ice cream machine on a US submarine was stolen. It wasn't
stolen from the submarine. It was stolen by the submarine. While the USS
*Tang* (SS-306) was in Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Dick O'Kane, the
captain, let it be known that he wanted an ice cream machine. It was not
then standard equipment for submarines. His comment was probably code
for "make it happen and I probably don't want to know how you did it."
The crew found an ice cream machine, on a pier, due to be installed in
the wardroom of the battleship USS *Tennessee*. The crew "acquired" it
and installed it in the pump room of the *Tang*.

This story should sound too good to be true, a veritable "sea story".
However, O'Kane made a reference to it in his book "Clear the Bridge"
when he mentioned a forged receipt that was left for the *Tennessee*.

After a war patrol, Admiral Lockwood, commander of submarines in the
Central Pacific, came aboard for the usual patrol debrief. When he was
served ice cream, he commented that the *Tang* had gotten the ice cream
aboard quickly. O'Kane confessed that they had made the ice cream on
board and showed Lockwood the machine. The admiral thought that was a
good idea, and ice cream machines became standard equipment on
submarines.

What flavors were available? It seemed to be that you could have any
flavor you wanted as long as it was white.

**How much personal storage was there?**

Not much. For the individual enlisted sailor, there was about one square
foot of storage, plus whatever could fit between the springs and the
mattress. Uniforms and cigarettes can be stored under the mattress.
Officers had a bit more storage, but they also had to store some
paperwork for themselves.

**What privacy was there?**

Obviously very little. Even the captain, who had a stateroom to himself,
didn't have a door to close. It isn't too much of a stretch to say that
there wasn't room for a private thought. However, everyone was in the
same situation. If you expected to have what privacy was possible, you
had to respect the privacy of others. Most often, that did work out
pretty well. If you needed to be left alone for a bit, you normally
would be.

**If the war patrols were 45 to 60 days, how much time off did the crew
get between them?**

Generally speaking, the crew was in port for about four weeks after
completing a full patrol. For the first two weeks, the crew had no
responsibilities for the boat and were on liberty the whole time. A
relief crew was responsible for the boat. (See below.) After that, the
crew returned to duty for specialized training, finishing any work on
repairs or upgrades on the boat, loading supplies and cleaning. Then
they would spend about a week training as a crew.

It was important to train as a full crew because there would be many new
faces on board for the next patrol. Many of these newcomers were new to
submarines and a few would be experienced hands returning to submarine
duty. About 15 to 20% of the crew would be replaced at the end of each
patrol. This was done to give some of the men a break after a series of
war patrols.

**Where would sailors be assigned when it was time for them to get a
longer break?**

The crewmen who were being rotated off the boat could be assigned to any
number of duties. One of the most common would be to new construction.
Submarines in the latter stages of being finished needed many
experienced crewmen. The men coming off combat would help finish the new
boat and provide the experienced core of the new crew. This way, they
would also get a few months break from combat while the new boat is
completed and then undergoes sea trials, post-construction repairs,
training and then the transit to their new homeport.

Other possibilities for assignments included training billets, division
or squadron staff or relief crews. Relief crews were the experienced
sailors who would take over for the first two weeks for boats coming off
patrol. They started or assisted with repairs and upgrading equipment as
needed. They were fully responsible for the boat so that the crew could
get the full two weeks off. However, the commanding officer, executive
officer and senior department heads would often monitor the work being
done on the boat even during that two-week-off period.

After about six war patrols, submarines were given an overhaul.
Overhauls were extended maintenance periods for larger repairs and the
installation training for new equipment. The hull might be cleaned for
better speed. It could also be repainted. This would often be back on
the West Coast so the added transit time is also part of the longer
break between patrols.

**How are things different before a sailor is qualified?**

When you report aboard your first submarine you are a non-qualified puke
(NQP), a life form just below pond scum. Another version of this is that
you are a useless food-consuming being (UFB).

The main point is that you have a great deal of work to do before you
are a qualified submariner. You are expected to spend your spare time
working on your quals. During that time, you are not allowed to watch
movies or play games. Your spare time, such as it may be, is supposed to
be spent on your qualifications.

**What did they do for entertainment once they completed
qualifications?**

The most common thing would be playing cards chess, or checkers. Acey
deucey was a Navy version of backgammon. Cribbage was a frequent card
game along with Bridge in the wardroom. There were also books and the
radio. There were also movies, although not all were recent and they
would often be shown multiple times.

Playing cards had to be specially made or adjusted to be used under red
lights. The hearts, diamonds and red numbers disappear in red light.
(See below for information about the red lights.)

When out in the Western Pacific, the radio would pick up Tokyo Rose, who
was actually different persons at various times. The sailors would laugh
at the propaganda -- it was interesting to find out you had been sunk
multiple times -- but the music was surprisingly current.

In addition, there would be the normal jumping to conclusions and the
good-natured harassment of each other.

**What does it feel like to be submerged?**

As long as you are OK being in small space, it doesn't feel much
different. You are inside the pressure hull, meaning that the pressure
you feel personally isn't very different. It is sort of like being in a
passenger plane. The change in pressure isn't very noticeable. The
difference, of course, is that in airplanes, the outside pressure is
less. In submarines, it is greater but it is still outside the pressure
hull. In short, it was no big deal. Depending on the weather and the sea
state topside, being submerged might be preferable

The hull will compress a little when you go deep. However, at least on
these WW2 boats, it isn't enough to notice a pressure change. It may
still be enough to mess with the new crew members. You can tie a string
from one side of the hull to the other and pull it tight when on or near
the surface. Then, as you go deeper and the hull compresses, the string
will sag all out of proportion to the actual compression. It looks far
more significant than it is.

**Does the hull creak when you go deep?**

It does, a little, on these WW2 boats. However, it isn't a big deal.
Soon you will barely notice it because it has become a normal noise. You
might even forget that it made noise.

**Do you feel the motion when you are submerged?**

Yes, but it quickly gets to be at a lesser amount. Down at 100 to 150
feet, the wave motion from the typical swells is mostly or completely
gone. The boat is much steadier. However, you probably will be aware of
up and down angles during larger changes in depth. Those are due to
operation of the boat and are separate from wave action.

Shortly after leaving port, the captain will usually do "angles and
dangles." This is normally announced in advance. The captain would then
order depth changes with larger up and down angles. This is done to
shake loose any equipment and supplies that aren't stored properly. This
provides an opportunity to store everything properly before it can
become a problem.

**Why was there red lighting in some spaces?**

The primary purpose was to protect night vision. When going from white
lights to darkness -- in this case up on the Bridge or looking through
the periscope -- we are practically blind for 15 seconds or more. We
were sending men up to the Bridge in darkness. We would prefer that they
didn't hurt themselves getting there. When going from red lights to
darkness, we usually avoid the time that we are completely blind.

It also reduces the time to get full night vision. Although some people
claim that it takes hours to get our full night vision, we can get most
of it in about 20 minutes if we come from white lights. If, however, we
come from red lights we get most of our night vision back in about 10
minutes.

The lookouts in WW2 were looking for smoke on the horizon, usually the
first indication of enemy ships. There may not have been a moon up yet,
or maybe the sky was clouded over. They were looking for smoke in a
dark, grey night. We needed to give the lookouts the best chance of
seeing enemy activity that we could.

When getting ready for a watch on the Bridge, sailors would usually be
given red glasses or goggles to help preserve their night vision. This
would prevent a stray flashlight or match from doing any damage to
someone's night vision. However, all flashlights used in red-light
spaces should have a red lens for the same reason.

It also prevents white lights from giving away our location. White
lights can show a beam for a great distance. If you remember the first
9/11 memorials in New York City, you know what this means. The memorials
were just lights shining up to the sky from where the towers had stood.
Those beams of light were visible for miles all around. Submarines don't
want to show something like that.

**How much of the boat was "rigged for red"?**

Most of the boat would be rigged for red. Only Maneuvering and the
engine rooms would still be using white lights. The After Torpedo Room
would be rigged for red for sleeping purposes. Crew there would have to
go through the machinery spaces to get to the bridge where they are
exposed to white lights unless they are wearing red glasses.

**Did the red lights cause any difficulties?**

No serious difficulties. It is a bit harder to see gauges and labels in
red lights, but we get used to that quickly. The most famous issue is
that it was briefly impossible to play cards. If you have a deck in true
red light, the red numbers and spots (hearts and diamonds) completely
disappear. Sub sailors are quite resourceful and quickly solved the
problem. They outlined the hearts and diamonds, and repeated the
numbers, in black. Soon there was a deck of cards printed for
submarines. Google "submarine playing cards" at [Submarine Cards ---
Submarine Playing Cards --- The World of Playing Cards
(wopc.co.uk)](https://www.wopc.co.uk/usa/brown-and-bigelow/submarine)
for examples of how they solved the problem.

**How can I avoid an issue like this at home?**

We experience this most commonly when coming out of the bathroom at
night. We turn off the lights and open the door, and we see nothing for
15 seconds or so. One solution would be to install red lights in the
bathroom. However, that's not likely to happen.

Another option is to do the "pirate thing." (What on earth are we
talking about here? Is this person nuts?) You have probably noticed that
nearly all depictions of pirates include an eye patch. Certainly, you
didn't think that **every** pirate has lost an eye to injury. Pirates
wear the eye patch when they are inside their lighted ship. Then, when
they go up on deck, they flip the eye patch out of the way. Now they can
see out of the eye that had been covered while the other is still
adjusting to the dark. We don't need to use an eye patch. Just close one
eye about 15 seconds before we turn out the lights. It looks strange for
a bit, but it works.

**What messages did the crew get from home?**

Very few, if any. Unlike today, there was no way to call or text the
family back at home. There were also significant concerns about
security. Finally, there were concerns about servicemen getting bad news
when they couldn't do anything about it. There was no sense letting
someone know about serious problems at home when he couldn't do anything
at all about it.

Letters were the obvious means of communications with families. Sailors
might write regularly, but there was no incoming or outgoing mail when
at sea. Large surface ships might get or send mail occasionally using
replenishment ships. Since submarines operated separately or in small
groups, there were no postal deliveries. As a result, sailors would
receive mail from home and friends in batches. They would also mail
their letters out in batches.

Outgoing mail would be censored. It would normally be read by one of the
officers and there might be some holes where sensitive information was
cut out. Naturally, some sailors would develop code words or phrases
that would provide some very basic information about what was happening.
However, orders were secret before departure and the crew would not
normally know where they would be patrolling next. There wasn't much
they could give away.

This is still mostly true today. There are family grams, a limited
number of messages that could be sent from home to the crew,
particularly for the missile boats. However, they are screened for
security and to make sure they wouldn't upset a sailor who couldn't do
anything about a problem.

**How do you get exercise when on a submarine?**

On the WW2 boats, it is often claimed that the only exercise the men got
was jumping to conclusions or playfully harassing each other. The fact
is that there wasn't the room, and often not the time, for regular
exercise. There was usually some work going on during the day in the few
compartments with space. As a result, the only real exercise would come
from whatever manual work you had to do or going up and down ladders.

**Where are the offices?**

There are only the two offices on the boat. There is the Log Office,
which is the tiny space in the Maneuvering Room for the Engineering
Department. The ship's office, for the Yeoman, is a bit larger and is
located across from the Goat Locker in the Forward Battery. The
captain's cabin has a desk and a bit more storage, but isn't really an
office.

**Did the captain get the fancy room with only one bunk?**

The captain did get the separate cabin all to himself, although it isn't
that fancy. It did allow a minimum of privacy, although there was only a
curtain instead of a door. He did have his own desk as well as course
and depth indicators. It should also be noted that he would probably be
awakened often, in accordance with his night orders. He would want to
know of any potential enemy contacts as soon as possible. He would also
want to know when the battery charge was completed and when the boat was
prepared for the activities of the next day. In peacetime, the captain
would also want to know whenever any ship was expected to come within
five miles of the boat. He would expect to know what the OOD was doing
to stay clear of the other ship.

**Did captains always get credit for ships they sank?**

They didn't always think so. The first issue is that captains often
overestimated the type of ship that was attacked, the damage done and
the tonnage sunk. This estimate would be more accurate if the target was
positively identified and then sunk. It helped if some of the wreckage
with the ship's identification could be recovered.

Then there were reviews of the claims by the individual captains by the
submarine commanders for the area -- the Central Pacific and the
Southwest Pacific. Monitoring Japanese radio traffic could often confirm
sinkings and the identities of those ships. That could increase the
captains' claims but most often reduced them

The final review, after the war, was by the Joint Army--Navy Assessment
Committee (JANAC) which audited Japanese naval losses in WW2. This
almost always resulted in captains losing credit for some ships sunk.
Japanese records may not have been complete, particularly with regard to
smaller vessels, those under 500 tons. Many submarine captains believed
that they did not get full credit for the ships they sank.

**What was JANAC?**

JANAC -- "Joint Army--Navy Assessment Committee was a United States
inter-service agency set up to analyze and assess Japanese naval and
merchant marine shipping losses caused by U.S. and Allied forces during
World War II." (From Wikipedia.) This committee reconciled American and
Japanese records to try to confirm sinkings.

**What was "Liberty"?**

Liberty was, and still is, time off for sailors when not on duty
overnight or when visiting a port. Usually, one third of the crew will
remain on board at all times so that the ship can get underway if needed
during an emergency. The other two thirds may have liberty. Liberty is
usually just overnight or over a weekend assuming the sailor isn't part
of a duty section. It is not time off counted against leave.

**What was "Leave"?**

Leave is extended time off, similar to vacations in the civilian world.
It was earned at a consistent rate and an individual's leave balance was
tracked. There was a limit during peacetime as to how much leave could
be accrued without losing the days over the limit. Leave not taken would
be paid out when the sailor leaves the Navy.
