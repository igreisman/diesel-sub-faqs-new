    <p>Not completely true.  In addition to the cuts, bruises, broken bones and routine illnesses, the medics handled many emergency issues that came up.  For example, there were three known appendectomies done on boats so they could stay on patrol.  The first one was done on the Seadragon in 1942.  The patient was in great pain and the medic thought he could do the surgery.  The patient gave his consent.  The operation took two and a half hours was done "by the book" with the medic following the descriptions and diagrams in his medical books.  The patient recovered fully.  A few notes:</p><p>The surgery was done submerged, at 120 feet, to provide a steady platform.</p><p>It was done on the wardroom table with the Executive Officer as the chief assistant.</p><p>Ether was used as the anesthetic which can be dangerous in the closed spaces of a submerged submarine with no access to fresh air.</p><p>Some instruments had to be devised from wardroom silverware.  For example, a tea strainer was used as a mask to administer the ether and bent spoons were retractors.</p><p></p><p>In late 1942, successful appendectomies were also performed on the Grayback and on the Silversides.  After that, the Navy issued orders that pharmacist mates were not to perform any further appendectomies.  It would seem unlikely that there were no more cases of appendicitis on board submarines, but there do not appear to be any records of other surgeries.</p>
