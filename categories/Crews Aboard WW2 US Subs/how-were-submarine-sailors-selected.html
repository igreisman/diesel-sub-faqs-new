    <p>Normally, the first requirement is that you have to volunteer. You have to be odd enough to want to be on a submarine. (We like to say that submariners' brains are wired differently.)  When someone offered you an opportunity to be stuffed into a 16-foot diameter pipe with 79 of your closest friends and then go down 400 feet or more below the surface of the ocean, that had to sound like a good idea.</p>

    <p>Normally, the first requirement is that you have to volunteer.  You have to be odd enough to want to be on a submarine.  (We like to say that submariners' brains are wired differently.)  When someone offered you an opportunity to be stuffed into a 16-foot diameter pipe with 79 of your closest friends and then go down 400 feet or more below the surface of the ocean, that had to sound like a good idea.  In fact, you usually had to ask to be a submariner.</p><p></p><p>The next step is that you have to be selected as a candidate.  There are actually more volunteers than there are billets (positions or spaces) in submarines.  As a result, the submarine force gets their pick of candidates.  This is one of the reasons that submarine crews tend to be better than the average in the rest of the Navy.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the selected candidates are screened for even temperaments.  There would be psychological testing if the Navy hasn't already had a lengthy opportunity to observe you.  The Submarine Force is looking for men (and now women) who are even tempered, who will "take an even strain."  Which candidates get along well with others and pitch in when there is extra work to do?  Who will be a strong part of the team when a challenge, emergency or crisis arises.</p>
