    <p>This is a senior enlisted man (or woman) who has a special assignment on the boat.  The COB was often, but not always, the most senior chief on board.  The Chief of the Boat, or COB, is the go-between for the captain and XO and the enlisted crew.  Although the COB is not an officer, he or she is treated as the third most senior person on board.  The COB monitors morale and is a key part of training the crew in submarine qualifications.  The COB defuses situations before they require formal punishment and may impose modest, informal punishment to keep issues off the record.  This position has a long history on submarines and, in the early 1970's, was implemented throughout the military as command master chiefs or command master sergeants.</p><p></p><p>In WW2, the COB was appointed by the CO and XO.  They would select the chief who had the best leadership qualities.  Currently, being a COB is a career track.  The Navy offers specific training and qualifications.  The COB is now appointed by the Navy, similar to the way the CO and XO are assigned.  The COB is part of the command team and reaps the rewards for the success of the whole boat, as well as the discipline for significant failures.</p>
