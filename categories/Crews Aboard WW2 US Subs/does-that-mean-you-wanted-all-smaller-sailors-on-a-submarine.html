    <p>Not really. It might be helpful to have some smaller sailors who could get into tight spaces to do some of the maintenance work. However, you needed some bigger men to push (technically to pull with pulleys and ropes) the 3,200-pound torpedoes into the tubes.</p>

However, you needed some bigger men to push (technically to pull with pulleys and ropes) the 3,200-pound torpedoes into the tubes.  You may also need someone to lift the heavy cylinder liners for the engines into place.  The shells for the 5-inch gun weighed over 70 pounds.  In short, you do want a number of good-sized sailors in the crew to do some of the heavy lifting and pulling.</p><p></p><p>The result is that you would have men of various sizes in the crew.  It probably reflected the variety of the population in general, although with fewer basketball players.</p>
