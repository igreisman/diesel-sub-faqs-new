Most sailors hadn't had a chance to go home and be exposed to children who tend to spread such illnesses.  If there was a cold or flu on board, it would probably spread rapidly because of the close living conditions and then die out.</p><p></p><p>They did not expect to treat men with tropical diseases like those of the rescued POWs.</p>
