    <p>Yes, they did.  Sailors who were qualified in submarines had an "SS" added to their ratings.  For example, radioman a third class who has qualified in submarines would have his rating upgraded from RM3 to RM3(SS).  This is a formal designation noted in the man's service record.  Similar to the officer's designation, this did not limit their future assignments.</p>
