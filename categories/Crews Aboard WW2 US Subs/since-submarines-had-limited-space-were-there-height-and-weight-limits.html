    <p>There was a height limit on these boats.  During WW2, it was six feet, four inches or 1.93 meters.  That means two things.  First, if you are six feet or taller, you probably won't be able to stretch out on your bunk.  You will sleep on your side curled up a bit.  Second, it means there are multiple obstructions available for you to locate with your head.  In that case, some important medical advice applies: if it hurts when you do that, don't do that.  A tall crew member who has been on a submarine even for a short while may appear to pay no attention to those painful obstacles, but he has already located them all - and not all the hard way.  Submariners tend to be reasonably bright.</p><p></p><p>Location memory helps.  In the dark in your home, you know where the furniture is and you avoid it.  Unless, of course, someone has just added something or rearranged everything.</p><p></p><p>Weight was a different issue.  There were weight limits, adjusted for height, to be met when joining the Navy.  During WW2, there were no official limits after that.  However, there might be informal pressure if you carried too much weight.  You might not want to struggle through the watertight doors if you were seriously overweight.  There have also been reports that the stench on the boats tended to suppress appetites.</p><p></p><p>At some point after the war, the rules changed.  You then had to under the weight limits each time you reenlisted.</p><p></p><p>Those were the maximums.  The minimum height and weight limits applied to everyone in the Navy when enlisting.  There were no separate requirements for submarine service.</p>
