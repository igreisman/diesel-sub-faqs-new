    <p>The usual program for diesel submarines was three months of sub school in New London for enlisted crew and six months for officers. This was in addition to any training for the enlisted crew in their ratings (specialties.)  Once you got to your submarine, the training began in earnest. During WW2, the training in sub school was condensed and sometimes skipped completely.</p>

    <p>The usual program for diesel submarines was three months of sub school in New London for enlisted crew and six months for officers.  This was in addition to any training for the enlisted crew in their ratings (specialties.)  Once you got to your submarine, the training began in earnest.</p><p></p><p>During WW2, the training in sub school was condensed and sometimes skipped completely.  If you went to sub school, it would be about half the normal time or about six weeks for enlisted men and three months for officers.  For experienced sailors, sub school may be skipped altogether.</p><p></p><p>NOTE: The process for submarine school has changed, particularly for those who have been nuclear-trained.  They will likely be sent to their boats after nuclear power school but without sub school so that the nuclear training doesn't erode before they can use it.</p><p></p><p>When you got to your submarine, it was assumed that you actually knew very little.  In fact, that was correct in that you had little practical experience.  Your first job would be to become a qualified watchstander so you could start to carry your share of the workload.  The next thing would be to earn your dolphins, to qualify for duty in submarines.</p><p></p><p>Qualifying usually required at least six months for enlisted men and at least a year for officers.  You had to demonstrate your knowledge of all the basic systems on the boat.  For an enlisted sailor, this would mean passing an oral exam while going through the boat with the Chief of the boat (COB) and then with the commanding officer or executive officer.  An officer would qualify on another, similar submarine.  The process would include rigging the boat for dive, diving the boat and conducting a practice attack.</p><p></p><p>The key thing about submarines is that you need to be able to respond quickly to any emergency.  There are no damage control parties on a boat.  It is up to whoever is in the space to respond and resolve an emergency.  In order to do that, you need to know the systems in any space.</p>
