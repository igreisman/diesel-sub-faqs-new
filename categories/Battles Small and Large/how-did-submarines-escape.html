    <p>If the submarine was submerged, the most important thing would be to be very quiet so that the Japanese sonar didn't pick us up.  Most often, that also meant moving very slowly.</p><p></p><p>Once an attack run was started by a Japanese ASW ship, they would approach at high speed.  They too have to get clear of the explosion.  When they are running at high speed their sonar would be overwhelmed by their own ship noises and the flow of water over their equipment.  That allows the submarine captain a brief opportunity for evasion tactics such as turning or changing depth or speed.  However, if there are multiple ships attacking the submarine, the others can move slowly enough for their sonars to still be effective.</p><p></p><p>Generally, it was a cat and mouse game.  It would be the wits and ingenuity of the submarine captain against his attacker(s).  The submarine also had the advantage of using all three dimensions.  The attackers had to estimate not just where the submarine was but also how deep it was.  Depth charges had to get pretty close - probably within 25 feet or so - to the submarine to breach the hull and sink it.</p><p></p><p>Our submarines were rather sturdy and could absorb a fair amount of damage.  Sometimes the key was to contain and repair the damage long enough so that the Japanese would just assume that they must have been successful.</p><p></p><p>Outlast them %%%%</p><p></p><p>There is also an ejection tube in the After Torpedo Room.  That tube can be used to launch a countermeasure.  The most primitive version is a compound that generates bubbles when it is ejected into water.  (It behaves very much like a giant Alka Seltzer.)  This provides two targets for the Japanese sonar since any change in density will reflect sonar, either the steel hull or the empty bubbles.  This only a temporary decoy since the bubbles will disburse and rise to the surface.</p><p>%%%%  Was this available to US boats in WW2.  It was to the Germans.</p><p></p><p>Captains would also be looking for a "layer."  That is a sudden change in temperature as the boat goes deeper.  The change in temperature can distort sonar, bending it to confuse the pulse, or even reflect it allowing the submarine to hide.  Such a layer is called a thermocline.  There is a bathythermograph in the Control Room.  It is a small box that records the water temperature at various depths.</p><p></p><p>If the submarine is on the surface, other factors come into play.  Of course, one choice is to submerge quickly and then turn or go deep before the attacker comes close.</p><p></p><p>Assuming that it is in the hours of darkness, there are things that can help make the submarine less visible to an attacker.</p><p>Point away for lowest profile.</p><p>Experimented with colors to be least visible.</p><p>Might be able to outrun the attacker if it is small enough.</p><p>Fog or rain squalls</p><p>Hope no bioluminescence</p>
