Once the boat was pointed at the target, the captain could determine which way it was moving relative to the boat.  He could then decide what course to take to get in front of the target to be able to attack.</p><p></p><p>At some point, if there was a chance of getting close enough for an attack, the captain would call for the tracking party.  It would help provide confirmation of the captain's estimates and allows him to make needed adjustments.  Eventually, if it appears that the submarine can get within firing range of the target, the captain will call the full crew to battle stations and attack.</p>
