    <p>She certainly did.  However, just for clarification, submarines were no longer riveted as they had been in World War 1.  They were welded.  As a result, it might be more accurate to say that "Wendy the Welder" helped build submarines.</p><p></p><p>In any case, many women went to work in defense plants during the war.  Some did administrative work and others did drawing jobs.  But many others did the riveting and the welding.  In fact, after initially resisting having women in the shipyards, management often found that women were better welders than the men.  They were patient and some skills, such as sewing, did make the training easier.</p><p></p><p>Two of Pampanito's engines were named, somewhat unflatteringly, after two of the women who worked in the Portsmouth shipyard.</p>
