    <p>We had a huge Navy and decided to keep only about half of it active. That included aircraft carriers, cruisers and destroyers as well as submarines. Many of the ships we didn't keep were added to the reserve fleet.</p>

    <p>We had a huge Navy and decided to keep only about half of it active.  That included aircraft carriers, cruisers and destroyers as well as submarines.  Many of the ships we didn't keep were added to the reserve fleet.  Others were used in live weapons tests or sold to friendly nations.</p><p></p><p>The boats that we kept active after the war would be upgraded starting in the early 1950s.  Guns were removed; the sail was streamlined and made more efficient.  Snorkels were added so that boats did not have to surface to recharge the batteries or get fresh air in the boat.  With a snorkel, that could now be done from periscope depth.  Later, there would be a GUPPY program to improve battery capacity.</p>
