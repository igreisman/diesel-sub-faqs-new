    <p>Visitors who have served on our latest submarines tell us that they are completely different from the Pampanito and exactly the same. They are telling us that the functions are the same – diving, surfacing, being quiet, being sneaky, gathering intelligence, and attacking the ships of an enemy in wartime. How those functions are accomplished may be very different.</p>

    <p>Visitors who have served on our latest submarines tell us that they are completely different from the Pampanito and exactly the same.  They are telling us that the functions are the same – diving, surfacing, being quiet, being sneaky, gathering intelligence, and attacking the ships of an enemy in wartime.  How those functions are accomplished may be very different.  Buttons, switches and computers help to accomplish many tasks that were very manual on the Pampanito.  In addition, modern submarines are much larger and cleaner.  However, there isn't enough space to play basketball.</p><p></p><p>Pampanito is much bigger than I expected.  I thought submarines were crowded.</p><p>The boat is long but narrow.  It is almost 312 feet long.  However, the pressure hull, where the crew lived and worked, is only 16 feet in diameter and around 280 feet long.  The bottom level is all machinery and much more equipment is on the main level such as the tops of the engines and generators, fresh water stills, torpedo tubes, reload torpedoes and the boat's controls.  As a result, there isn't much room left for the crew.</p><p></p><p>The submarine looks much bigger from the outside than it does from the inside, particularly with 80 crew members on board.</p>
