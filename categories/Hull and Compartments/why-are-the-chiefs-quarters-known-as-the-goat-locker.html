    <p>This is the space where the Chief Petty Officers, the highest-ranking enlisted men, sleep. The space is so named because the chiefs are the "old goats" in the Navy. On a submarine in WW2, they were as "old" as 28 or 30 years old.</p>

Nor does it imply that the chiefs smelled more like goats than the rest of us.  After a few days at sea, we all smelled pretty bad.</p><p></p><p>The chiefs' quarters are known as the goat locker throughout the Navy, not just on submarines.</p>
