    <p>That is actually a valid question. Modern submarines, even the non-nuclear boats of other navies, don't look anything like the Pampanito from the outside. They are sleek black shapes and are mostly underwater.</p>

    <p>That is actually a valid question.  Modern submarines, even the non-nuclear boats of other navies, don't look anything like the Pampanito from the outside.  They are sleek black shapes and are mostly underwater.  Only a little of the hull shows along with the upright sail.  Unlike the Pampanito, they have no guns.  But, yes, this is what was described as a submarine in World War 2.</p>
