    <p>We will be starting aft, or at the back of the boat, which is where both tours – online and in person - start.  The following are the various compartments, plus the bridge, along with the significant equipment in each:</p><p></p><p>After torpedo room including:</p><p>Four torpedo tubes, which would normally be loaded, plus four reload torpedoes.</p><p>Crew's bunks above the torpedoes</p><p>A signal gun to send out flares or decoy devices.</p><p>There is no lower level in this compartment since the propellor shafts pass through this area.</p><p>This space has the unique head that discharges directly over the side and cannot be used in port or when submerged.  It requires an eight-step process to flush since the water level outside the boat is significantly higher than the water and waste in the bowl.  If flushed incorrectly, the user gets to clean up the mess.</p><p>After escape trunk.</p><p>Charging unit for the Mark XVIII electric torpedoes.</p><p></p><p>Maneuvering room including:</p><p>The cubicle which is where power is distributed.</p><p>The large levers direct the power from an engine-generator combination either to the battery charge or to operate the boat.  These are separate circuits.  When the boat is submerged, the levers are changed to take the power from the battery to operate the boat.</p><p>Main motors on the lower level to drive the propellors via the reduction gears.  There are two motors per propellor shaft.</p><p>Motor order telegraphs.  These receive the orders from the bridge of conning tower for the desired speed.  They are then used to acknowledge the orders received and being executed.    There are two units, one for each propellor shaft.</p><p>Lathe for repairs.</p><p>An inverter to provide A/C power from the D/C battery or generators.</p><p>Log (or engineer's) office.  This tiny space is the second largest office on the boat.</p><p></p><p>After engine room including:</p><p>Two Fairbanks Morse, 10 cylinder, opposed-piston main engines producing about 1,500 horsepower each.  The engines extend to the lower level.</p><p>Two generators (one attached to each engine) to produce the needed electrical power.</p><p>A smaller, "donkey" diesel on the lower level that can be used to top off a battery charge.  This is a smaller Fairbanks-Morse, 7 cylinder, opposed-piston engine with associated generator.  These smaller engines were removed from active submarines in the 1950s.</p><p>Clean fuel tank.</p><p>Normal lube oil tank.</p><p>Associated fuel and oil pumps and filters.</p><p></p><p>Forward engine room including:</p><p>Two more Fairbanks-Morse main engine-generator combinations that also extend to the lower level.</p><p>Two Kleinschmidt stills for fresh water.</p><p>Air conditioning on the lower level.  This has been described as functioning more as a dehumidifier rather than actual air conditioning.  In other words, in WW2 it removed some moisture but didn't cool the air very well.</p><p>Clean fuel tank.</p><p>Normal lube oil tank.</p><p>Associated fuel and oil pumps and filters.</p><p></p><p>After battery including:</p><p>Crew's sinks, heads and showers.  The two heads are behind the metal doors opposite the wash machine.</p><p>Half of the boat's battery, 126 cells, is on the lower level.</p><p>Fan unit to pull the hydrogen out of the battery well so it does not reach combustible levels when charging the battery.  The air from the battery well is dumped into the engine rooms so the hydrogen can be burned.</p><p>Main crew's berthing with 36 bunks.</p><p>Pharmacist mate's medical locker.</p><p>Locker to hang service dress uniforms.</p><p>Smaller lockers for personal items.  Some smaller items would be stored under the mattresses.</p><p>Ice cream machine.</p><p>Crew's mess with four tables seating six men each.  Two tables have game boards embedded.</p><p>Galley, the small space next to the crew's mess where meals are cooked.  The third cook, the overnight baker, prepares bread, rolls, cakes and pies in this space.</p><p>A large coffee maker; coffee is always available.</p><p>The ammunition locker is on the lower level, port side forward.  The access hatch may be under the chest used for storage and seating.</p><p>Cold storage on the lower level.</p><p>Limited pantry space on the lower level.</p><p>Sinks to wash dishes.</p><p></p><p>Control room.  This is where the crew dives the boat, controls depth and returns to the surface.  It includes:</p><p>Radio room with radios and encoding/decoding equipment.</p><p>Controls for the low-pressure blower, used to empty ballast tanks of the last of the water.</p><p>Periscope wells.  The actual periscopes cannot be seen inside the wells nor can they be used from here.</p><p>High-pressure air manifold used to bring the boat back to the surface.</p><p>AC electrical switchboard.</p><p>Alarms – diving, collision and general quarters (battle stations) on one of the pericope wells.</p><p>Announcing systems.</p><p>Trim manifold.</p><p>Air search radar.</p><p>IFF query and display.</p><p>Diving officer's checklist.</p><p>Radar equipment.</p><p>Bow and stern plane control wheels.</p><p>Ladder and hatch up to the conning tower.</p><p>Hatch and ladder down to the pump room.</p><p>Chief of the watch station with the "Christmas Tree" display of the status of key valves and hatches.</p><p>Controls to main ballast tank vents.</p><p>Controls to special ballast tanks and main induction.</p><p>LORAN (Long Range Aid to Navigation).</p><p>Gyrocompass.</p><p>Bathythermograph.</p><p>Fathometer.</p><p>Boat's safe topped by a ladder up to the main deck.  This hatch has a small window to allow gun crews to see if the water above the hatch has drained away.</p><p>Backup helm.</p><p>Backup gyrocompass.</p><p>Magnetic compass.</p><p>Dead reckoning tracker.  The display of Pampanito's war patrols is on this DRT.</p><p>Note: The control room on the Pampanito is configured with red lights to show an example of the typical lighting at night.</p><p></p><p>The pump room which is below the control room.</p><p>Air compressors.</p><p>Trim pumps.</p><p>Drain pumps.</p><p>Hydraulic pumps.</p><p>The low-pressure blower to empty ballast tanks of the last of the water.</p><p>On some boats, the safe is located here.</p><p></p><p>Conning tower – the enclosed space above the control room including:</p><p>Hatch and ladder down to control room</p><p>Helm.</p><p>Course indicator.</p><p>Rudder indicator.</p><p>Motor order telegraphs.</p><p>Alarms.</p><p>Announcing systems.</p><p>Ladder and hatch to the bridge.</p><p>Sonar displays and controls.</p><p>SJ surface search radar display and controls.</p><p>ST surface search radar display.  This radar is in the search periscope.</p><p>Depth gauge.</p><p>Telegraph key.</p><p>Two periscopes, search and attack.</p><p>Dead reckoning tracker.</p><p>Torpedo data computer.</p><p>Torpedo firing keys.</p><p>Radio phone sets.</p><p>Sound-powered phones.</p><p></p><p>Bridge – the open space above the conning tower including:</p><p>Target bearing transmitters.</p><p>Announcing systems.</p><p>Lookout platforms on the periscope shears.</p><p>Signal lamp.</p><p>Course indicator.</p><p>Ships' guns including 20 mm and 40 mm, as installed.</p><p></p><p>Returning to the main level inside the pressure hull forward of the control room, we have the forward battery including:</p><p>Boat's office.  This is the large office on the boat.</p><p>Chief petty officers' berthing, also known as the "goat locker".</p><p>Captain's cabin with desk and depth and course indicators.</p><p>The other half of the boat's battery, 126 cells, is on the lower level.</p><p>Fan unit to pull the hydrogen out of the battery well.</p><p>Officers' berthing.</p><p>Wardroom for officers' meals, meetings and work space.</p><p>Serving galley.  Food is kept warm and served from here.  It is not cooked here.</p><p></p><p>Forward torpedo room</p><p>Six torpedo tubes (also normally loaded) and 10 reloads in skids (trays).</p><p>Crew's bunks above the torpedoes.</p><p>Sonar equipment.  Sonar can be operated from here, but there is no PPI display.</p><p>Charging unit for the Mark XVIII electric torpedoes.</p><p>Escape trunk.</p><p>Officers' head and shower.</p><p>This space has a shallow lower level that includes two of the six torpedo tubes and two of the reloads.</p>
