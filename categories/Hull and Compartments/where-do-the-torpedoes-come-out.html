You can see the outline of the rectangular doors.  That is because the boat is currently much lighter than it was when it was operational.  It does not have the 100 tons of battery cells, the nearly 400 tons of fuel, the full complement of torpedoes with live warheads, the food for the crew plus the 80 sailors and their gear.  If that were all on board, the boat would be sitting deeper in the water and the torpedo doors would be under water.</p>
