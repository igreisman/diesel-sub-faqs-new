    <p>Finding a truly quiet place to sleep is very unlikely.  There is constant activity on the boat.  The engines are probably running at night and you can hear them, perhaps at a low noise level, anywhere on the boat.  The battery is being charged.  The electricians will go in and out of the battery wells to check on the specific gravity, to monitor progress of the charge.  The boat is also on the surface which adds the noise of the boat cutting through the waves.  If the swells are small, the rocking of the boat can help you get to sleep.  If the swells are large, you may find yourself sleeping in odd positions so you can stay in your bunk.</p><p></p><p>The key here is to get used to the noise and light quickly.  It also helps to be tired after a long workday.</p>
