    <p>Most of them were, but that depended on where they were.  If they were in the tropics, we suspect that the boats were rarely if ever below 90 degrees.  And most of our boats were in the tropics for the majority of the time.  The first issue is that the water temperature is 80 to 85 degrees.  The next one is that the boat is constantly generating heat mainly from cooking, the engines and from charging or discharging the battery.  In the tropics, the engine rooms would easily reach 100 degrees.</p><p></p><p>When the engines were shut down when submerging, the cooling water to the engines would also shut down.  Then the engine rooms could reach 120 degrees and the rest of the boat could be 110.  It would take some time for the warm ocean waters to cool the boat back down.</p><p></p><p>There is air conditioning, but it was really little more than a dehumidifier.  Freidman, Page 200.  It helped but didn't really cool the boat that much.</p><p></p><p>If the boats were in northern or southern latitudes, the temperatures could be more moderate.  This was particularly true in spring and fall.</p><p></p><p>If the boats were operating off Alaska, they might actually be rather cold.  The Japanese occupied the last two islands in the Aleutian chain at the time of the Battle of Midway.  After that, we often had a submarine in the area monitoring any Japanese activity.  In that area, the air and water temperatures may well be in the low 30s.  If so, the boat would be cool or cold.  The crew might be wishing for some of that excess tropical heat.  It would also be cold in the boats during the winter if they were being tested during sea trials off Manitowoc, WI; Portsmouth, NH; or New London, CT.</p>
