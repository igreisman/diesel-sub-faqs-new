    <p>Rarely, if ever.  On a submarine, there isn't enough fresh water for everyone to take showers regularly.  This varied from boat to boat, but the stills only produced so much fresh water.  They were also famously unreliable.  If both stills were working at full capacity, they would produce about 5,000 gallons per week each.  They were rarely both working at capacity and, in the patrol area, you would not use the stills when submerged.  They use too much power and make too much noise.</p><p></p><p>The first 500 gallons each week has to be distilled twice for the battery.  The next claim for fresh water is the internal cooling systems for the engines.  However, the engines don't normally require much water each week.  The next claim would be by the cooks.  Water is needed for coffee or bug juice (a sort of Kool-Aid), to cook your food and to wash the dishes.  That leaves only a few gallons per day for the crew to brush their teeth, shave if they want to, and wash up a bit.</p><p></p><p>We would like to have the cooks and the pharmacist mate (medic) shower about once a week.  With so little water left after that, the rest of the crew would not normally take showers.  They might only get a bucket of water periodically from the air conditioning condensate to wash out skivvies and then take a sponge bath.  Since that water is extracted from the air in the boat, it will almost certainly have a thin sheen of oil on top.</p><p></p><p>Any showers would be "navy showers".  Fresh water is precious throughout the fleet, even where it is more plentiful than it was on submarines.  A navy shower means that the sailor wets down and then turns the water off.  He or she then soaps and lathers up.  Then the water is turned back on to rinse off.  Ideally, the total water usage is no more than three minutes.</p><p></p><p>San Francisco residents tend to use water efficiently and that is still about 60 gallons per day.  That would be over 5,000 gallons per day for 80 people plus the water needed for the battery.  Submarines often didn't make that much water in a week.</p>
