    <p>If we are talking about a patrol planned for 60 days or more, the simple answer is: everywhere.  Naturally, the limited pantry and cold storage spaces are full.  Large cans of coffee, sugar and flour would be stored outboard of the engines.  Eggs, butter and cheese would be stored in the forward escape trunk for as long as they lasted.  As warm as it might be, it was likely the coolest place on the boat.</p><p></p><p>Canned goods would be stored wherever there was room as long as they could be tied down securely and weren't in the way of operating equipment.  One logical place would be the berthing spaces in the battery compartments.  You would then be walking on your food – the cases of canned goods covered by cardboard or wood – until the crew ate the food down to the deck.</p><p></p><p>Sailors were often taking cans of peaches with them on patrol, as long as the cans fit in their individual storage.</p>
