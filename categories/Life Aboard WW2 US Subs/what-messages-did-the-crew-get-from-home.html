    <p>Very few, if any.  Unlike today, there was no way to call or text the family back at home.  There were also significant concerns about security.  Finally, there were concerns about servicemen getting bad news when they couldn't do anything about it.  There was no sense letting someone know about serious problems at home when he couldn't do anything at all about it.</p><p></p><p>Letters were the obvious means of communications with families.  Sailors might write regularly, but there was no incoming or outgoing mail when at sea.  Large surface ships might get or send mail occasionally using replenishment ships.  Since submarines operated separately or in small groups, there were no postal deliveries.  As a result, sailors would receive mail from home and friends in batches.  They would also mail their letters out in batches.</p><p></p><p>Outgoing mail would be censored.  It would normally be read by one of the officers and there might be some holes where sensitive information was cut out.  Naturally, some sailors would develop code words or phrases that would provide some very basic information about what was happening.  However, orders were secret before departure and the crew would not normally know where they would be patrolling next.  There wasn't much they could give away.</p><p></p><p>This is still mostly true today.  There are family grams, a limited number of messages that could be sent from home to the crew, particularly for the missile boats.  However, they are screened for security and to make sure they wouldn't upset a sailor who couldn't do anything about a problem.</p>
