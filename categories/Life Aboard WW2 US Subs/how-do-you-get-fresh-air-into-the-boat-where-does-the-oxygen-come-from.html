    <p>The best way to get breathable air in the boat is to run the engines to charge the battery. (To say it is fresh air may be a bit of a stretch.)  The air system is set up so that most of the air for the engines goes straight to the engine rooms. However, some of it goes to the ends of the boat and gets pulled toward the engine rooms, refreshing the air in all the spaces.</p>

    <p>The best way to get breathable air in the boat is to run the engines to charge the battery.  (To say it is fresh air may be a bit of a stretch.)  The air system is set up so that most of the air for the engines goes straight to the engine rooms.  However, some of it goes to the ends of the boat and gets pulled toward the engine rooms, refreshing the air in all the spaces.  Running the low-pressure blower to push the last of the water out of the ballast tanks would use the air in the middle of the boat, also pulling fresh air in, this time through the conning tower hatch.  The same thing would happen if the air compressors in the pump room were running to recharge the air banks.</p><p></p><p>The routine was to be on the surface every night.  This would hopefully top off the battery for the next day while freshening the air in the boat.  Being on the surface each night also allowed the boats get their messages and, if the skies were cooperative, get a position fix using stars at dusk and again at dawn.</p><p></p><p>If the boat had to remain submerged more than 16 hours - usually because it was being attacked - there were one-time measures that could be used.  The first of those were the six green oxygen bottles and the many CO2 absorbent cans in the overheads.  The silver-colored cans in the overhead, labeled "DO NOT PAINT", are the CO2 absorbent, typically lithium hydroxide.  These will give you a couple more hours of breathable air.</p><p></p><p>After that, the main option was to bleed air from the high-pressure air banks into the boat.  This would pressurize the boat somewhat, but would improve the O2 and CO2 percentages.  Even if the air in the boat were doubled, to two atmospheres, decompression would not be an issue.  It would about the same as swimming and diving down to about 25 feet.  To be clear, this air from the air banks isn't to be confused with fresh air, but it is air that allows the crew to survive.</p>
