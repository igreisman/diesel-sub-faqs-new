    <p>As long as you are OK being in small space, it doesn't feel much different. You are inside the pressure hull, meaning that the pressure you feel personally isn't very different. It is sort of like being in a passenger plane.</p>

    <p>As long as you are OK being in small space, it doesn't feel much different.  You are inside the pressure hull, meaning that the pressure you feel personally isn't very different.  It is sort of like being in a passenger plane.  The change in pressure isn't very noticeable.  The difference, of course, is that in airplanes, the outside pressure is less.  In submarines, it is greater but it is still outside the pressure hull.  In short, it was no big deal.  Depending on the weather and the sea state topside, being submerged might be preferable</p><p></p><p>The hull will compress a little when you go deep.  However, at least on these WW2 boats, it isn't enough to notice a pressure change.  It may still be enough to mess with the new crew members.  You can tie a string from one side of the hull to the other and pull it tight when on or near the surface.  Then, as you go deeper and the hull compresses, the string will sag all out of proportion to the actual compression.  It looks far more significant than it is.</p>
