    <p>There is some good news here.  Diesel submarines are like gardenias, night-blooming jasmine, tuberose and hydrogen sulfide.  (Hydrogen sulfide is a poisonous gas that smells like rotten eggs.  However, submarines aren't usually poisonous.)  What all these things, and many others, have in common with submarines is that after 15 to 30 minutes you stop smelling it.  Olfactory nerves get saturated and stop sending signals to your brain.  The nerves give up.  You don't get used to the smell; you stop smelling it.  You only notice the new smells, like fresh-baked bread and rolls at night.</p><p></p><p>This is what makes hydrogen sulfide so dangerous.  You no longer smell it but it can still kill you.  The good news is that it is very rare to have hydrogen sulfide on an operating boat since it develops in closed spaces.  We have very few of those and almost never go into them when at sea.</p><p></p><p>Even if you are up on the bridge for a watch, the olfactory nerves don't normally reset.  You are still mostly "protected" when you come down off the bridge.</p>
