    <p>They didn't. These submarines did not have the capability to make or store large quantities of oxygen or to remove CO2. (Modern submarines do, and that's why they can be submerged for two or three months at a time.)  In the WW2 boats, the air that they were breathing was the same air they had been breathing since they submerged.</p>

    <p>They didn't.  These submarines did not have the capability to make or store large quantities of oxygen or to remove CO2.  (Modern submarines do, and that's why they can be submerged for two or three months at a time.)  In the WW2 boats, the air that they were breathing was the same air they had been breathing since they submerged.  That air was intended to last 16 to 18 hours.  Since most of the crew smoked, let's call it 16 hours.  The normal procedure would be to surface every night to get fresh air in the boat.</p>
