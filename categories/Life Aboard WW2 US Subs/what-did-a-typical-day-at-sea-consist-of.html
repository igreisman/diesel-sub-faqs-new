    <p>A typical day consisted of two four-hour shifts on watch plus time spent for maintenance, paperwork, studying and training.  The time between 08:00 and 16:00 (8 AM to 4 PM) would usually be a work day, when maintenance, etc. would be completed.  Twelve hours would not be unusual for a regular workday, and it could be even longer if the sailor was working toward his submarine qualification or studying for a promotion.</p><p></p><p>Sundays were a day of rest.  As long as there were no attacks in progress and no essential repairs, there would often be no routine work on those days.  In other words, on your day off you "only" stood eight hours of watch.</p><p></p><p>This assumes that there were three watch sections and the crew would be standing watches four hours on and then have eight hours off.  If there weren't three qualified watchstanders for a specific position, then watches would be "port and starboard", meaning something like four hours on and just four off duty.  That would last until a third watchstander could pass qualifications.  The routine would also be adjusted a bit by dogging the watch about once per week.</p><p></p><p>During the war, the routine would be changed by the need to carry out long attacks on enemy ships or by attacks on the boat by enemy ships and aircraft.  Either of those could last many hours and would involve the whole crew.  That would naturally require changes to the normal schedule and the boats would make whatever adjustments were needed for rest and food.</p><p></p><p>There were a few instances of captains reversing the day so that the crew would be working at night when the engines were running (and noisy) and pulling fresh and, hopefully, cooler air into the boat.  This would also mean that the boat could be submerged - quieter and calmer - while the crew is sleeping.  This was usually done only when in the tropics.  In these cases, the workday would be from 20:00 to 04:00 (8 PM to 4 AM) and meals would be offset by 12 hours.  For example, breakfast would be around 20:00 rather than at 08:00.  The crew would then sleep during daylight hours from 08:00 to 20:00.</p>
