    <p>In no particular order, some of the issues for submarines were a shortage of combat-ready ships; submarine captains who had been trained to be too conservative; significant torpedo problems; a faulty assumption that submarines would sail with the fleet; and the need to learn how to fight a modern war.  In more detail:</p><p></p><p>The shortage of combat-ready ships of all types.  President Franklin Roosevelt had been walking a tightrope between trying to keep the country out of the war, as most of the public preferred, and preparing to fight in the likely global conflict.  Fortunately, he managed to get funding from Congress to start building the ships we would need.  Unfortunately, it would take time to complete the ships that were ordered and then to build enough facilities to increase production after the attack on Pearl Harbor.  The first submarine of the new Gato designs to be completed, the USS Drum (SS-228) , had just been commissioned on November 1, 1941, in Kittery, Maine and was still on shakedown, post construction repairs and crew training.  She wouldn't be ready for combat until the spring of 1942.</p><p></p><p>Submarine captains had been trained to be conservative.  Pre-war training taught that if your boat was sighted, you were assumed to be sunk.  Being sighted in combat wasn't usually a good thing, but it wasn't always fatal either.  As a result of the conservative approach, captains were taught to fire torpedoes based on sonar bearings rather than risking having the periscope being seen.  We quickly established that sonar bearings alone weren't good enough.  Visual bearings to the targets were needed, particularly until we improved the quality of our sonar.</p><p></p><p>In order to overcome these mistakes in training and procedures, we would wind up replacing about one-third of the officers who were in command of submarines at the beginning of the war.</p><p></p><p>Not every good commanding officer in peace time would be aggressive enough for command in the war.  A general rule was that if a captain didn't produce results within two war patrols, he would likely be reassigned.  Some captains who "washed out" of submarines went on to distinguished careers in surface ships.</p><p></p><p>We had significant torpedo problems.  These are detailed in the section on torpedoes.  Generally speaking, testing was woefully inadequate and the Torpedo Bureau refused to believe that the problems were in the torpedoes.  The main issues were that the torpedoes ran too deep; the magnetic exploders generally did not work properly; and the contact exploders didn't always work either.  It would take almost two years to identify, acknowledge and then fix the major problems with our torpedoes.  It appears that, even then, no one was held accountable.</p><p></p><p>The assumption that submarines would sail with the fleet and engage the enemy before the big gun battles.  That's why they were called "fleet boats".  In hindsight, there were obvious problems with this theory:</p><p>After the attack on Pearl Harbor, there wasn't much of a fleet for submarines to sail with.</p><p>Even our newest submarines could barely keep up with our oldest and slowest battleships and cruisers.  Even then, they would have to sail on the surface and give up their greatest advantage - stealth.</p><p>It ignored the lessons of the Atlantic War where the German U-boats were beginning to cut the supply routes to England, an island nation.  Japan was just as dependent as Britain for the imported supplies needed to fight a war.</p><p></p><p>We needed to learn to fight a modern war.  The United States was barely involved in the naval parts of WW1.  There was a great deal of new equipment and technology that we needed to learn to use most effectively.  Japan had been at war in China for over five years.  They had a great deal of combat experience and had been actively training for the war that we still wanted to avoid.  It would take us about 18 months for us to catch up and become a truly effective fighting force.</p><p></p><p>Why was the submarine service known as the "Silent Service"</p><p>Silence, or being quiet, was a fact of life on submarines.  In WW2, it could mean the difference between making it home or being lost at sea.  Modern submarines are still designed to be as quiet as possible.  That doesn't mean you can't talk, but you surely didn't want to drop a wrench.</p><p></p><p>The lack of publicity about our submarines was a great advantage.  Sailors' lives could be saved if the enemy was kept in the dark about capabilities and intended operations.  Large fleets with frequent communications could be difficult to disguise or hide.  It was much easier for submarines.  They could submerge and severely limit radio and radar emissions.</p><p></p><p>When attacking the enemy or evading attack, being quiet was even more important.  The enemy's use of sonar was how submarines could be located.  Quiet boats were harder to find.  There were routines to run more quietly by shutting off as much equipment as possible.  Where possible, hydraulic systems, such as the bow and stern planes, were operated manually to avoid the noise of the pumps.  Even fans would be shut off to lower the noise level in the boat as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>Submarines took various steps to keep hidden when on patrol.  They were very aware of the dangers of using radar often.  The Japanese were listening and could locate a submarine by listening for their radars.  Boats even learned to sink their trash so that it couldn't be found by the Japanese.</p><p></p><p>Steps such as these deprived the enemy of a great deal of information.  "Silence is golden."</p>
