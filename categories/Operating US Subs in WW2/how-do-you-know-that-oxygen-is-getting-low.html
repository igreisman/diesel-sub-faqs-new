    <p>Even without a gauge of some sort, there are signs that oxygen is getting low. Probably the first would be labored breathing. Men would have to breathe deep in order to get enough oxygen into their lungs.</p>

    <p>Even without a gauge of some sort, there are signs that oxygen is getting low.  Probably the first would be labored breathing.  Men would have to breathe deep in order to get enough oxygen into their lungs.  This gets to be the feeling that there is an elephant sitting on your chest.  Added to that would be headaches among the crew.  They can be pretty intense and painful when oxygen is very low.</p><p></p><p>Another indicator is that the air no longer supports combustion.  It becomes impossible to light a cigarette because the match or lighter can't burn.  This puts the "smoking lamp" out and slows the rate of oxygen consumption ever so slightly.  There is still free oxygen in the air, but the level has definitely decreased.  It would certainly be time to do something about the poor air in the boat.</p>
