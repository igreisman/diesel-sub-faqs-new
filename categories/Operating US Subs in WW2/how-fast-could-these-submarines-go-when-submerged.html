    <p>Top speed submerged was 9 or 9 ½ knots or a bit over 10 miles per hour.  However, top speed would be limited to less than an hour before the battery is completely drained of power.  The usual speed submerged would be 2 to 3 knots.  Higher speeds might be used to gain attack position.  Higher speeds could be used to try to escape being attacked but that usually made more noise.  Slow, silent and clever might be more effective.</p><p></p><p>The ship's battery was usually rated at 48 hours if the boat was going 2 knots.  The ratio of speed to power needed was cubic.  Generally, if you double the speed, eight times the power was needed.  If the speed was doubled from 2 to 4 knots, the battery would last approximately six hours.  Double it again, and the battery likely won't last an hour.  It is called the "one-hour rate."</p>
