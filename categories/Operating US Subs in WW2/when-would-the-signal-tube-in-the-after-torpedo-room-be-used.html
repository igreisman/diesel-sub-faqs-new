    <p>If it were needed for signaling, we would launch flares from that tube.  This would be used mostly when doing training exercises with other U. S. ships and planes.  The color of the flare contains the message.  For example:</p><p>A green flare is fired by the submarine when the boat would have launched torpedoes if this weren't an exercise.  That would mean that the boat had sunk the carrier or tanker, etc.</p><p>A red flare is fired by the submarine when it is in trouble and needs to surface quickly. All surface ships need to get clear of the area as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>The signal tube can also be used to launch decoys.  Modern decoys are sophisticated and complex.  In submarines like the Pampanito, the countermeasure is fairly basic.  It consists of a bubble generator, much like the German pillenwerfer, made of calcium hydride.  When it contacts water, it generates a large volume of bubbles.  Air bubbles reflect sound (sonar) just as the submarine's hull would.  It is the change in density that reflects the sound.  If you are familiar with Alka Seltzer, you know that it reacts with water and creates fizz or bubbles.  The countermeasures are similar.  (However, Alka Seltzer uses different chemicals, bicarbonates.)  A fictional example can be seen in the movie "The Hunt for Red October."  When the Russian aircraft drops a torpedo to try to sink "Red October," the boat releases a pair of decoys that tumble and generate bubbles in an attempt to confuse the torpedo's sonar.</p><p></p><p>Some modern decoys can be much more sophisticated.  They would be launched from a torpedo tube and generate noises just like another submarine.  That includes the power plant noises as well as propellors, pumps and other sounds that submarines normally make.  They do a much better job of providing another "target" and confusing the other guys sonar.</p>
